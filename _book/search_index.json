Living on or just below the sediment, they play vital ecosystem roles such as decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients and providing a major food source for fish and birds. They can also provide key ‘signals’ about the condition of the benthic environment, and have been used worldwide to develop biotic indices for measuring and tracking estuarine health. However, many of these indices have been developed for northern hemisphere systems, and applying them to south-western Australian estuaries has proved difficult and/or ineffective for various reasons. This report was aimed firstly at characterising the current benthic macroinvertebrate community throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and secondly at building a robust biotic index of benthic ecological health (the Benthic Community Index – BCI) and exploring its patterns across the estuary. We also explored which aspects of the benthic environment were best linked to changes in the invertebrate community and health grades (‘A,’ excellent, to ‘E,’ very poor) of the BCI. Our findings show that while the current invertebrate community is species rich (72 species), it is dominated by a small number of environmentally-tolerant taxa, including various worm species (e.g. Capitella sp., Heteromastus filiformis and Prionospio cirrifera) and bivalve species (e.g. Arthritica semen and the invasive Asian date mussel Arcuatula senhousia). The community is generally representative of one in early stages of development (or ‘early succession’), which are typically found in environments that experience chronic stress. The invertebrate community showed substantially greater differences between regions of the estuary (e.g.basin vsriverine areas) than between seasons (winter vs summer) or different water depths (shallow, &lt; 1 m vs deep, &gt; 1m). These regional differences were strongly linked with those in bottom-water salinity, depth of oxygen penetration into the sediment, sediment odour and sedimentary microalgae (which provides food for many invertebrate taxa). To build the BCI, a diverse suite of 16 attributes (‘metrics’) calculated from the invertebrate community were first tested for their responsiveness to an independent gradient of benthic environmental condition across the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Three metrics (species richness, diversity and dominance) showed the clearest responses, and were then used to construct an index that incorporated metric reference conditions (or benchmarks of ‘best’ metric scores) that were tailored for each broad region and season. The BCI showed that benthic ecological health is generally better in winter (mainly good to fair, or grades B–C) than summer (mainly fair to poor, or grades C–D). These trends most likely reflected the effects of winter river flows flushing sedimentary organic matter out of the estuary, and helping oxygenate the bottom waters and sediment. This is well supported by the clear relationships that were found between increasing BCI grade and decreasing trends in sedimentary organic matter and mud content and increasing oxygen penetration and odour score. From a spatial perspective, benthic ecological health was often poorest (poor to very poor, or grades D–E) in the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, the deeper sections of the basins (especially in summer) and in the shallow south-eastern area of Peel Inlet (including in the deeper navigational channels near the entrance of the Murray River). In some cases, the sediment was completely lacking in invertebrate fauna. These areas coincide with some of the most highly enriched (nutrients and organic matter) and muddy sediments and, in the case of the south-eastern Peel, areas of high macroalgal growth. These findings have significant implications for the ongoing benthic health of the estuary, given the forecast trends of less freshwater flushing of the estuary under a drying climate, and the proposed expansion of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Finally, we have proposed a benthic invertebrate monitoring plan to enable the ecological health of the Peel-Harvey to be reliably tracked into the future, and provide further decision support for management intervention. Figure 1.1: Bait worm Marphysa sanguinea, showing gill structures (Photo, S. Cronin-O’Reilly). 1.2 Background Benthic macroinvertebrates are bottom-dwelling invertebrates, &gt; 500 µm in size, that live on the sediment surface or just below it in structures such as burrows or self-made tubes (Snelgrove, 1998). These faunal communities consist mainly of polychaetes (worms), molluscs (e.g. bivalves) and crustaceans (e.g. shrimps and crabs; Fig 1). They are a fundamental component of the healthy functioning of estuarine ecosystems, performing vital roles such as decomposing the vast organic matter that accumulates in these environments, recycling nutrients and providing rich food sources for many fish and bird species. They are also excellent indicators of the ecological health status of estuaries and other waterways, which is reflected by well-established changes in the species composition of the invertebrate communities. For example, degraded estuaries often have faunas with low numbers of species that are dominated by polychaetes, which are often more tolerant of environmental stress than the more sensitive molluscs and especially crustaceans (e.g. Warwick and Clarke, 1993; Wildsmith et al., 2009; Tweedley et al., 2012). Figure 1.2: Examples of benthic invertebrates collected from the Peel-Harvey. (Photos; 1a &amp; c, S. Cronin-O-Reilly; 1b, M. Wildsmith). For the above reasons, many environmental management agencies worldwide have developed biotic indices based on key attributes of these invertebrate communities to measure and track the ecological health of estuaries and other aquatic environments. They provide key ‘signals’ about ecosystem functioning that cannot be captured by simply measuring the environment alone. Some of the most well-known and widely adopted indices include the Azti Marine Biotic Index (Borja et al., 2000), the Benthic Opportunistic Polychaete and Amphipod ratio (Dauvin and Ruellet, 2007) and the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (Weisberg et al., 1997). Many of these existing indices focus on the tolerance of different invertebrate species to environmental stress (e.g. organic matter enrichment) and have largely been developed for estuaries in the northern hemisphere, for which extensive knowledge exists on species sensitivity. However, applying these indices to estuaries in south-western Australia (and others in the southern hemisphere) has proved difficult or ineffective because (i) our small, shallow and increasingly poorly-flushed estuaries function differently from the often larger and well-flushed systems of the northern hemisphere, and (ii) our invertebrate faunas are very dissimilar, and their sensitivity is largely unknown (Tweedley et al., 2014). To date, studies of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the Peel-Harvey Estuary have concentrated on restricted parts of the estuary basins, times of year and/or subsets of the faunal community, with their main focus on exploring inter-decadal changes between pre-Dawesville Cut (1970s or 1980s) and post-Cut periods (early to mid-2000s; Whisson et al., 2004; Wildsmith et al., 2009). Both of these studies have generally shown the loss of more environmentally-sensitive crustacean and molluscan taxa and increases in more tolerant annelid taxa over time. Given it has been 15 years since the benthic invertebrate faunas have been assessed across the Peel-Harvey, and no previous studies have included the faunas in the tidal rivers, the first part of our study was aimed at characterising the current benthic macroinvertebrate community throughout the full extent of the estuary. Secondly, as a comprehensive index of benthic ecological health is still lacking for this system (and most others across south-western Australia), we then focused on building a suitable and robust index from the benthic macroinvertebrate community (the Benthic Community Index – BCI) and exploring its patterns across the estuary. The specific study objectives are outlined below. 1.3 Objectives Characterise the current benthic macroinvertebrate community throughout the full extent of the Peel-Harvey Estuary during both wet and dry seasons. Explore which environmental drivers are best linked to any spatial or seasonal changes in the invertebrate community. Build an index of benthic ecological health (the BCI) using key attributes (‘metrics’) of the invertebrate community, and develop a benthic health ‘report card’ (grades A–E) for the estuary. Explore trends in the BCI among estuary regions and seasons in 2017–18, and which sediment condition variables are best linked to those trends. Propose an ongoing monitoring regime for tracking benthic ecological health throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 1.4 Approach 1.4.1 Characterizing the benthic invertebrate community and the benthic environment 1.4.1.1 Field and laboratory methods Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at 60 sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary during both late winter 2017 (high rainfall period – ‘wet’ season) and late summer 2018 (low rainfall period – ‘dry’ season; Fig. 1.3). The location of the sampling sites was governed by the following three factors to account for both anthropogenic and natural environmental influences on the condition of the benthic environment and their accompanying invertebrate communities. Sites were positioned to provide the best possible spread across these factors (with the first being of primary interest), while also keeping the time requirements for both field sampling and lab processing within an achievable window. The condition of the sediment (i.e. Good, Fair or Poor), as determined by the Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) for characterizing sediment condition, based on scores for sediment colour, odour and texture developed by Hallett et al. (2019a) and presented in the complementary ARC Linkage report Hallett et al. (2019b). The guide for how the sediment at each site was scored and assigned to a RAP class is given in Table 1, with some examples shown in Fig. 1.4. Regional differences in water movement (e.g. tidal and river flushing) and water quality (e.g. salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature), as guided by the coupled catchment-estuary model developed within the broader ARC Linkage Project (Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019). The main regions were the Southern Harvey Estuary; Northern Harvey Estuary/Western Peel Inlet; Eastern Peel Inlet; Serpentine River; Lower Murray River; Upper Murray River (Fig. 1.3). Water depth, accounting for both shallow (&lt; 1 m deep) and deeper (≥ 1 m deep) waters. It is recognized that the effects of human-derived stressors (e.g. the downstream impacts of high catchment nutrient loads, organic matter loads from livestock effluent etc.) and natural environmental influences act synergistically to influence benthic environmental condition in estuaries. However, sediment condition was considered to mainly reflect the culmination of anthropogenic influences in the catchment and estuary, and regional and depth differences were considered to represent natural environmental drivers. Figure 1.3: Map of the sites at which benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled across the Peel-Harvey Estuary in winter 2017 and summer 2018. Sites have been colour-coded by their RAP sediment condition class in summer 2018 (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor; see Table 1 and Fig. 3). Note that these condition classes differed for some sites in winter 2017, as shown in Figs 11 and 12. Figure 1.4: Cores of sediments classified as (a) Good, (b) Fair and (c) Poor condition based on their RAP scores for sediment colour, texture and odour (from Hallett et al., 2019b). The RAP sediment condition classification of 97 sites across the estuary by Hallett et al. (2019b) in late 2016 was used as an initial guide for selecting a representative subset of invertebrate sampling sites. At each selected site (and in each season), two replicate sediment cores were collected using a corer with a telescopic pole and a detachable, transparent PVC tube (600 mm long and 60 mm in diameter; Fig. 4). One of the replicate cores was used to measure various characteristics of the sediment, as outlined in Table 2. The remaining replicate sediment core was wet-sieved through a 500 µm mesh, and all invertebrates retained were preserved in a 4% formalin solution buffered in estuary water. In the laboratory, all invertebrate samples were stored in a 70% ethanol solution, then the numbers of individuals belonging to each species (or lowest possible taxon) counted in each sample. Various water quality characteristics, including salinity, temperature (°C) and dissolved oxygen (mg L−1), were also recorded at the bottom of the water column at each site on each sampling occasion using a multiparameter water quality probe (YSI 556). Figure 1.5: (a) Collecting sediment cores using a telescopic corer with a detachable PVC coring tube; (b) Sieving sediment samples to collect benthic invertebrates (Photos, S. Cronin-O’Reilly). 1.4.1.2 Data analyses Analysis of the 2017–18 invertebrate species abundance data focused on determining the nature, extent and environmental drivers of any significant shifts in community composition between estuarine regions, seasons, water depths and also sediment condition. Note that, while every effort was made to find sites representing each sediment condition class (i.e. Good, Fair, Poor) in each region, season and depth, they were not present in all combinations of those latter three factors. Consequently, analyses of invertebrate community differences among condition classes were undertaken separately from the combined analyses for region season depth, though were guided by the outcomes of the latter test (i.e. condition region depth tests were undertaken separately for each season, and only those significant terms involving condition were further interpreted). The footnote on p11 provides further technical explanation on the practicalities and drawbacks of this testing approach, and the subsequent choices for other condition-based analyses in section 4.2. The environmental variables that were correlated with the invertebrate data included all of the sediment variables outlined in Table 2, as well as the water quality variables measured at the time of faunal sampling (see section 4.1.1). All data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Anderson et al., 2008). 1.5 Building an index of benthic ecological health An index of benthic ecological health (the BCI), reflected as a ‘report card’ grading system from A (excellent health) to E (very poor health), was built from key attributes (‘metrics’) derived from the invertebrate species abundance data outlined in section 4.1.2. The list of candidate metrics that were trialed, and the ones that were selected to comprise the index, are shown in Table 3. The method used to construct this index is summarised in Fig. 5, which outlines from left to right (i) the main steps in building the index; (ii) further detail underpinning each main step; (iii) the main statistical methods used (all of which were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software [Clarke and Gorley, 2015] with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module [Anderson et al., 2008]); (iv) key data inputs into the statistical methods; and (iv) main outputs of the statistical methods. The overarching approach was similar to that for the Fish Community Index, broadly outlined in Hallett et al. (2019b) and described in detail in Hallett et al. (2012). The main difference between these approaches was that whereas a large historical and current data set was available to build a time-based gradient for selecting the most informative fish metrics (numerous interannual periods between 1978–2018), this was not the case for the invertebrate data (with historical data existing only for the late 1970s, 1986/7, 2000 and 2003/4, and sometimes for only restricted parts of the basin, times of year and/or subsets of the invertebrate community; Whisson et al., 2004; Wildsmith et al., 2009). Instead, a continuous spatial ‘benthic condition gradient,’ built from key sediment variables shown to best reflect differences in sediment condition scores throughout the estuary, was used as the premise for selecting the most informative (i.e. responsive) invertebrate metrics. To display BCI trends throughout the estuary in both the wet and dry seasons, BCI scores calculated at each sampling site were spatially interpolated across the full extent of the system using QGIS 2.18. Figure 1.6: Summary of the approach used to build the Benthic Community Index, outlining, from left to right, (i) the main steps in constructing the index; (ii) more detail underpinning each main step; (iii) main statistical methods used; (iv) key data inputs into the statistical methods (PCA, Principal Components Analysis; BEST, Biota and Environment Matching routine; DISTLM, Distance Based Linear Models) and (iv) main statistical outputs. 1.6 Main Findings The benthic invertebrate community is species rich, but dominated by a small number of taxa that are highly tolerant to environmental stress and represent only the early stages of community development More than 70 benthic invertebrate species were found across the estuary in 2017–18 (Appendix 1). They represented nine broader phyla, but more than 75% of species belonged to just two phyla, namely Annelida (worms; 30 species) and Arthropoda (crustaceans such as shrimps and crabs; 23 species). Thirteen species of Mollusca (shelled organisms) were found, but the remaining six phyla were each represented by only one species (Appendix 1). We found a greater overall number of species than Wildsmith et al. (2009) in 2003–04 (63), most likely because this previous study was restricted to northern Harvey Estuary/western Peel Inlet whereas the current study covered the full breadth of the estuary and the tidal rivers. Species such as the worms Desdemona ornata and Pseudopolydora kempi and the bivalves Mysella spp. and Arcuatula senhousia, were abundant in this study, but were either not recorded or found in low numbers by Wildsmith et al. (2009). The largely marine and well-flushed northern Harvey/western Peel region had by far the most species (55), while the upper Murray River had the least (18). This decline in species richness along a marine to riverine gradient is common in south-western Australian estuaries, not only for benthic invertebrates (e.g. Wildsmith et al., 2017), but also for other fauna such as fish (e.g. Valesini et al., 2017). However, 60% of the species found in the northern Harvey/western Peel each made very small contributions (≤0.5%) to the total number of invertebrates recorded in that region, with many being ‘marine stragglers’ that occur infrequently in the marine reaches of estuaries, e.g. the worms Heteromastus filiformis, Malacoceros tripartitus and Mediomastus sp. In contrast, only 28% of the species in the upper Murray made similarly small contributions to the fauna in that region, reflecting a more restricted community that is well adapted to deal with environmental stress. Further evidence of this is the far lower total abundance of invertebrates found in the upper Murray, i.e. about one third to one fifth of that in other regions (Appendix 1). Figure 1.7: Examples of common invertebrates (a) Corophium minor, (b) Arthritica semen, (c) Arcuatula senhousia (Photos; S. Cronin-O-Reilly). The amphipod Corophium minor (Fig. 6a), a small crustacean which is endemic to south-western Australia, was the most abundant species across all basin regions. The polychaete worms H. filiformis and Prionospio cirrifera, which live on the sediment surface and feed on accumulated organic matter, were highly abundant in the western Peel/northern Harvey and/or eastern Peel Inlet, and especially in the deeper waters where these organic deposits are often greatest. The small bivalve Mysella spp. was also abundant across Peel Inlet and the northern Harvey, where it mainly inhabited sandier substrates. Tanaid crustaceans, which were highly abundant only in the southern Harvey Estuary, live in self-made tubes in the sediment and feed mainly on detritus and algae (Rumbold et al., 2015). Their abundance in this region is possibly symptomatic of the long-term and increasing macroalgal growths that are present there (Valesini et al., 2019). Regions of the estuary that directly receive freshwater input (i.e. the Serpentine and Murray rivers and, to a lesser extent, the southern Harvey Estuary), all had high numbers of the small bivalve A. semen (Fig. 6b) and the worm Simplisetia spp. These species are both adapted to live in brackish reaches of estuaries (Semeniuk and Wurm, 2000; Hirst, 2004). Large aggregations of A. semen, and to a lesser extent the worms D. ornata and Capitella sp., were mainly responsible for the high total number of invertebrates recorded in the Serpentine River (Appendix 1). In the freshest parts of the estuary (i.e. the upper then lower Murray River), further species such as the invasive Asian date mussel A. senhousia (Fig. 6c), the amphipods Paracorophium excavatum and Grandidierella spp., and the worms P. kempi and Boccardiella limnicola, were also relatively abundant. Many of the above-mentioned dominant species in the Peel-Harvey Estuary are recognised globally as highly tolerant and opportunistic, e.g. the worms Capitella sp., H. filiformis, P. cirrifera, P. kempi and the Asian date mussel A. senhousia (Tweedley et al., 2016). Such taxa represent the first stages of invertebrate community development following an environmental disturbance, as they are small, short-lived and can reproduce quickly, allowing them to readily colonise uninhabited areas (Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978). This so-called pattern of ‘early succession’ has also been found in other coastal waterways experiencing chronic environmental stress, both through natural processes (e.g. highly variable salinity; Ritter et al., 2005) and human-driven processes (e.g. organic and nutrient enrichment of sediments; Tagliapietra et al., 2012; Fig 7). Additionally, unlike many large suspension/filter feeding invertebrate species that typify healthy estuaries in the northern hemisphere, many of the common species in the Peel-Harvey and nearby Swan-Canning Estuary lack a pelagic (floating or swimming) larval stage in their development (Rose et al., 2019). Instead, species such as A. semen brood their young in their shell cavity (Wells and Threlfall, 1982) and Capitella spp. broods in self-made tubes (Rose et al., 2019). This may be an adaptive strategy to safeguard their early life stages from stressful conditions, but also restricts species dispersal and the rate of community succession, keeping it in an early stage of development. Figure 1.8: Benthic invertebrate community development along a gradient of increasing environmental stress. Diverse faunas are gradually replaced by a small number of dominant species (often highly tolerant worms and select bivalves). Regional differences in salinity and sediment oxygen, odour and microalgae exert the greatest influence on the invertebrate community Regional differences in the benthic invertebrate community throughout the estuary were generally about twice as strong as differences among seasons (winter vs summer), water depth (shallow vs deep) or sediment condition class (Good, Fair, Poor). The community still differed significantly among each of the latter factors, but the magnitude of change was usually far smaller (Appendix 2). Regional shifts in the fauna were strongly correlated with combinations of salinity, depth of the sediment oxic layer, sediment odour and the quantity of microalgae living near the sediment surface (BEST, P = 0.01–0.02, Spearman rank correlation = 0.78–0.87). The regional patterns in the species composition of the invertebrate fauna are illustrated on the plots in Figs 8a and 9a. They have been displayed for each season (Fig. 8a) and water depth (Fig. 9a) to accommodate significant ‘interaction effects’ with those other sampling factors (i.e. contrasting regional trends across different seasons and depths; Appendix 2a). Based on the simple premise that points lying close together on these plots have similar faunas while those further apart have greater differences, it is clear that there was a distinct shift in the invertebrate communities between the estuary basins (western Peel/northern Harvey, eastern Peel and south Harvey regions, all lying to the left on plots) and the tidal Murray River (lower and particularly the upper regions, lying to the right), while those in the Serpentine River bridged this spectrum. The key invertebrate species that mainly drove these regional shifts in the community are summarised in the ‘shadeplots’ in Figs 8b and 9b (simply the darker the shading, the more abundant the species). The basin regions were characterised by a wider spectrum of species, including many with affinities for the marine conditions and/or abundant seagrass and macroalgae present in that part of the estuary. These included various amphipods (e.g. C. minor, Eusiridae spp. and Grandidierella spp.), bivalves (Spisula trigonella and Mysella spp.) and tolerant worms (H. filiformis and P. cirrifera). The Serpentine River was distinctive for its particularly high numbers of the worms D. ornata (though only in the wet season), Capitella sp. and Simplisetia spp., as well as the tolerant bivalve A. semen (especially in the dry season and in the shallows). The key species in the Murray River, however, differed from those in the Serpentine. In the lower Murray, the crustaceans Grandidierella spp. and P. excavatum and the worms Scoloplos normalis and P. kempi dominated, but largely in the dry season and in shallows. In the wet season and/or deeper waters, the invertebrate fauna was relatively depauperate and comprised mainly tolerant or opportunistic species, e.g. midge larvae (Chironomidae spp.) and worms such as oligochaetes and Capitella sp. Faunas in the upper Murray were also restricted, and were largely represented by highly tolerant worms (B. limnicola, S. normalis), the invasive Asian date mussel (A. senhousia) and other taxa with affinities for fresher waters (e.g. Chironomidae spp. and Coleoptera spp.). The regional shifts in the invertebrate community from basin to riverine areas were shown to be best linked with (i) decreasing salinities from marine to essentially freshwater conditions; (ii) less oxygen permeating the sediment; (iii) increasingly malodorous sediment; and (iv) increases in sediment microalgae (Fig. 10). With respect to salinity, regional differences were far greater in winter when they ranged from an average of ~31 in the western Peel/northern Harvey (close to sea water) to ~2 in the upper Murray (fresh water; Fig. 10a). Marine waters (~35) permeated most regions in summer, except for the upper Murray which remained brackish (~15). In contrast, the shallowing of the sediment oxic layer between the basin and riverine regions was more apparent in summer (Fig. 10b). Figure 1.9: (a) Plot of the relative similarity of the invertebrate communities in each region (colour coded: WP/NH, Western Peel Inlet/ Northern Harvey Estuary; EP, Eastern Peel Inlet; SH, Southern Harvey Estuary; SP, Serpentine River; LM, Lower Murray River; UM, Upper Murray River) and season (black labels: W, Wet; D, Dry) sampled in the Peel-Harvey in 2017–18.

Points closer together have more similar communities, and sampling depths in each region are joined by colour-coded lines. Plots have been constructed using MDS ordination. (b) Shadeplot of the average abundance of key invertebrate species in each region and depth. Abundance is shown on a grey scale from most abundant (black) to absent (white), and has been plotted from pretreated not raw data. These trends match the long water residence times in the estuary during low river flows (Huang et al., 2019), which in turn leads to deoxygenation of the bottom waters and the sediment. Interestingly, low sediment oxygen persisted year-round in the Serpentine River (~0.7–1.5 cm of oxic sediment; Fig. 10b), and was also prevalent in some basin regions (southern Harvey and eastern Peel) in one or more seasons. The most malodourous sediments (reflecting the production of hydrogen sulphide or ‘rotten-egg gas’ under anoxic conditions) matched several of the trends in sediment oxygen, being worst in the deeper waters of the upper Murray, Serpentine River and the shallows of the eastern Peel (Fig. 10c). ‘Signals’ of these environmental conditions were evident in the invertebrate fauna. For example, the worm Capitella sp, which was far more abundant in the Serpentine than any other region and dominated in both seasons and water depths, is well able to persist in low oxygen conditions (Diaz and Rosenberg 1995). Other closely related species are also highly tolerant of hydrogen sulphide (Gamenick et al., 1998). The most obvious regional shifts in the amount of sediment microalgae, which provides a food source for deposit-feeding invertebrates, were the far lower quantities in the most marine and highly flushed region (western Peel/northern Harvey) compared to the upper Murray (Fig. 10d). These trends almost certainly reflect the far lower sediment nutrient concentrations in the western Peel/northern Harvey than any other part of the estuary, and particularly the upper Murray, most of which is highly enriched (Hallett et al., 2019b). The higher microalgal concentrations in the shallows than deeper waters of most regions (Fig. 10d) very likely reflects the greater light availability in those environments to support benthic algal growth. A separate set of tests to explore sediment condition impacts on the invertebrate community in each season showed that they were relatively strong in winter, when their influence was not too far behind that of regional differences and far stronger than depth differences (Appendix 2b). Faunas in the poor sediment class were the most distinct, and were generally characterised by less species than their ‘fair-good’ counterparts, as well as lower abundances of species that were present. Additionally, species such as the worms Australonereis ehlersi (which builds U-shaped burrows in sandy sediments and has strong jaws for eating other invertebrates; Beesley et al., 2000) and D. ornata (a predominantly deposit-feeding fan worm that is relatively sensitive to environmental stress; Borja et al., 2000; Rossi, 2002) showed clear preferences for good sediments and were mostly absent from poor sediments. The fauna also differed significantly among condition classes in summer, with poor vs good sediments being most distinct, but these differences were comparatively weak (Appendix 2c). It should be noted, however, that since not all condition classes were well represented in each region, season and depth combination (see footnote), these findings may underrepresent the true influence of sediment condition on the invertebrate fauna. Further exploration of how particular attributes (‘metrics’) of the invertebrate community relate to the full spectrum of sediment condition is presented below in the findings for the Benthic Community Index. Figure 1.11: Plots showing the relative similarity of invertebrate communities in each region (colour-coded; see Fig. 8 for full names) and season (a; W, Wet; D, Dry) or depth (b–d; S, Shallow; D, Deep). Invertebrate sample points (those closer together have more similar communities) have been overlaid with key sediment condition variables (represented by circles of proportionate sizes) known to best ‘explain’ the observed patterns in the fauna. Plots have been constructed using MDS ordination. The benthic ecological health of the estuary was mainly good to fair in the wet season, but fair to poor in the dry season The Benthic Community Index, interpolated across the whole estuary from the index scores calculated for each site in each season, showed that overall benthic health was better in the wet than dry season (Figs 11 and 12). In the wet season, large sections of the basins (excepting the south-eastern Peel Inlet) were classified as having a good (B grade) to far (C grade) health status, with some sites near the Dawesville Channel and in the shallows of the northern Harvey in excellent health (A grade; Fig. 11). Most of the Serpentine River was also in fair to good benthic health, while this was only true for intermittent sections of the Murray River and mainly in its shallow lower reaches. In the dry season, however, most of the basins were in fair (C grade) to poor (D grade) benthic health (excepting again some healthy sites near the Cut and in the shallows), with some sites near navigation channels in the eastern Peel Inlet (Yunderup canals) in very poor condition (E grade; Fig. 12). Most of the upper Murray was also in poor to very poor condition (D/E grade), though the lower Murray and Serpentine typically had a far to good health status (C/B grade), with a few sites even being in excellent health (A grade). The poorer health grades in the dry season, which were especially evident in the deeper waters, mainly reflected conspicuous decreases in species richness and diversity (Fig. 13). This was particularly evident in the upper Murray River, with several samples containing no invertebrates at all (Fig. 13d). In the shallows, health declines between the wet and dry season were most obvious in the eastern Peel Inlet, and were driven mainly by a drop in species diversity (Fig. 13a, c). The generally healthier benthic condition in the wet season is most likely related to the freshwater flushing of the system at that time of year, helping to remove sedimentary organic matter and increase oxygenation of the bottom waters and sediment. This is well supported by the clear relationships that were detected between increasing health grades of the benthic invertebrate community, and decreasing trends in sedimentary organic matter and mud content and increasing oxygen penetration and odour score (Fig. 14). Although there was general agreement between the benthic health grades (A–E) and the RAP sediment condition grades (Good, Fair, Poor), which can be seen by comparing the BCI scores (interpolated ‘background’ colours) with the RAP grades (colour-coded sites) in Figs 11 and 12, there were a few exceptions. For example, several sites in the Murray River in the wet season had a low BCI grade (D–E) but a Good RAP grade. This may reflect the influence of higher freshwater flows improving sediment condition (e.g. by flushing out organic matter and mud), but also dislodging invertebrate fauna.

Separate lines on each plot represent each region of the estuary (WP/NH, Western Peel Inlet/ Northern Harvey Estuary; EP, Eastern Peel Inlet; SH, Southern Harvey Estuary; SP, Serpentine River; LM, Lower Murray River; UM, Upper Murray River). Figure 1.15: Averages of each sediment condition variable (aRPD [oxic sediment depth], odour, organic content, left y-axis; mud content, right y-axis) in each Benthic Community Index grade (A, excellent to E, very poor). Benthic ecological health is generally poorest in the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, deeper waters of the basins and in the south-eastern Peel Inlet Poor to very poor BCI grades were most commonly recorded in the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, the deeper sections of the basins (especially in the dry season) and in the shallow south-eastern area of Peel Inlet (including the deeper navigational channels near the entrance of the Murray River; Figs 11, 12). The deeper parts of the upper Murray were characterised by faunas with a low species richness and diversity in winter, and were highly depauperate in summer when they either contained just one species or were totally lacking invertebrate fauna (Fig. 13b, d). The deeper waters of all basin regions, and especially the southern Harvey Estuary, had among the lowest species richness and/or diversity in summer, as did the shallows of the eastern Peel in both seasons (Fig. 13). The above areas typically corresponded with either fair to poor RAP sediment condition in the current study (Figs 11 and 12), and the most highly enriched (including both nutrient and organic matter content) and muddier sediments found by Hallett et al. (2019b) in the companion study on sediment health. These poorer quality sediments, and subsequently less healthy benthic invertebrate faunas, typically intersect with poorly flushed, depositional environments. The shallow south-eastern Peel Inlet also has a high biomass of green macroalgae, which has largely persisted throughout the 40-year macrophyte monitoring record in the Peel-Harvey Estuary and even increased in recent years (Valesini et al., 2019). Large accumulations of macroalgae can also contribute to sediment deoxygenation and enrichment, with the sediment acting as a source of nutrients to fuel further macrophyte growth (Lavery and McComb, 1991). These findings have significant implications for the ongoing benthic ecological health of the estuary, given the forecast trends of less freshwater flushing under a drying climate, and the proposed expansion of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 1.7 Conclusions The benthic invertebrate community generally reflects a stressed benthic environment Although a large number of benthic invertebrate species was recorded throughout the estuary in 2017–18, the community was mainly dominated by a small number of environmentally-tolerant taxa. These species are reflective of a community in its early stages of development, or one that is typically found following an environmental disturbance, i.e. recolonisers that are small, short-lived and reproduce rapidly. The main environmental drivers of changes in the species composition of the invertebrate community included some that are natural (salinity and the amount of sedimentary microalgae) and others that are often linked to human-derived stressors (the depth of oxygen penetration into the sediment and strong sediment odours). Benthic ecological health is in a poor to very poor state in poorly-flushed, depositional areas of the estuary The BCI developed in this study detected poor to very poor benthic ecological health (grades D–E) in many depositional areas of the estuary, such as the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, deeper sections of the basins, and the south-eastern Peel Inlet (including both the shallows and deeper navigational channels near the entrance of the Murray River). This was particularly the case in summer, when there is virtually no river flushing and water residence times are high. These poor ecological health grades were clearly linked to increasing sediment organic matter and mud content and little to no oxygen penetrating the sediment. Given the projections for an increasingly drier climate, and proposed expansions of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey Estuary, it is anticipated that these benthic ecological health trends will become more persistent and expansive. This could have a host of flow-on effects for the ecological function, resilience and biodiversity of the estuary, through channels such as its ability to recycle nutrients and organic matter, and provide nutritious food for higher fauna such as fish and birds. Establishing a regular benthic invertebrate monitoring regime is fundamental to assessing and tracking measures to improve ongoing benthic ecological health The 2017–18 invertebrate species abundance data has enabled a comprehensive understanding of the current invertebrate community in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and provides a greater spatial spread of information on this fauna than has ever been collected across the system. It has also enabled calculation of the BCI. However, given that the BCI is based on data collected over just one year, the metric reference conditions on which the grading system is based are limited. To strengthen understanding of the ‘best’ metric values (and open the possibility of including further metrics in the index that begin to show strong responses to sediment condition), it is recommended that at least a further four consecutive years of invertebrate data are collected (see Table 4) to help bolster the robustness of the BCI. Following on from the above, it is imperative that a consistent and regular invertebrate monitoring program is continued to better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this key ecosystem component into the future. A broad program for the future monitoring of the benthic health of the Peel-Harvey via the BCI (and accompanying RAP) is proposed in Table 4 and Fig. 15. Finer details for implementing this program will need to be determined, following clarity in level of interest in uptake and resourcing.

Their component species typically occupy habitats from the top to bottom of the water column, feed across most levels of estuarine food webs, and encompass varied behavioral traits and estuarine use patterns. Taking a community-wide view can thus reveal many clues about the cumulative and complex impacts of the estuarine environment on higher ecological health. As a result, biotic indices that integrate key traits of fish communities, scored against established ‘benchmark’ or reference conditions, have been used to measure, monitor and report the ecological health of estuaries worldwide. This study focused on applying a Fish Community Index (FCI) to the Peel-Harvey Estuary to measure and track its ecological health over a 40-year period from 1978 to 2018. It also aimed to link patterns in the FCI to key environmental drivers to support forecasting of ecological health under different environmental scenarios. The FCI, which was developed specifically for south-western Australian estuaries, synthesises complex information from different structural and functional metrics of the fish community into simple ‘report card’ grades (A, very good, to E, very poor). The long historical fish community data set that exists for the Peel-Harvey was supplemented by two further years of fish sampling in the current study (2016-2018), which covered a greater spatial range in both the shallow (&lt;1.5 m deep) and deeper waters (&gt;1.5 m deep) than had ever been sampled previously. While this 40 year data set provides a rare basis for setting metric benchmark conditions (especially in the shallow basins where most historical data was collected), inconsistencies in sampling methods over time, gaps in the data record, and a relative lack of data in the deeper waters and rivers, has hampered some interpretations of longer-term health. Moving forward, we have proposed a consistent fish monitoring regime for the Peel-Harvey to enable its ecological health to be reliably tracked with the FCI into the future. Based on the available evidence, our findings show that there has been a slight improvement in the health of the shallow river environments from 1978-2018, from poor (grade D) to fair (grade C), while the shallow basin waters have remained in fair health. The condition of the deeper waters, however, and especially in the basins, has declined from a good health status (grade B) to a fair/poor status (C/D). The improvements in the shallow rivers mainly reflect an increased dominance of small hardyhead species that are specialist feeders and can spawn in the estuary, rather than the opportunistic or detritus-feeding species that previously dominated these areas. The more obvious decline in the deeper basins, however, reflected a clear shift in the fish fauna from one that was relatively species-rich, abundant and contained more benthic-associated and/or estuarine individuals (all of which positively influence the FCI, e.g. Estuary cobbler, Mulloway, Yellow-finned whiting and Western striped grunter), to one that is more depauperate (with no fish being caught on several sampling occasions), sporadic and dominated by marine species (traits which negatively influence the FCI, e,g. Tailor, Southern eagle rays, Herring and Weeping toadfish). The opening of the Dawesville Cut in the mid-1990s, combined with a drying climate, has clearly led to a ‘marinisation’ of the fish fauna. However, the above declines in ecological health may also reflect (i) declines in the health of the benthic invertebrate fauna upon which many of these species feed, (ii) decreases in green macroalgal growths (especially in Peel Inlet) which can provide abundant fish food and shelter, (iii) increased water clarity and thus net avoidance and/or (iv) fishing pressure impacts on targeted species. More detailed analysis of the current (2016–2018) FCI trends showed that, overall, the estuary is in fair to poor health (grades C–D). At a finer regional and seasonal resolution, trends in the shallow nearshore waters were often inconsistent, possibly reflecting that large areas of the basins are extremely shallow and prone to rapid environmental changes, and are dominated by small, highly-schooling species which can lead to variable catches. One worrying trend that was consistent in the shallows, however, was the often poor to very poor health (grade D–E) in the Mandurah Entrance Channel. This reflected a far lower number of species since the 1970s/80s, as well as clear drops in abundance of various specialist feeding, estuarine-spawning and/or bottom-dwelling species (e.g. Long-finned goby, Bridled goby and Small-toothed flounder), and increases in the relative proportions of opportunistic species such as Weeping toadfish. Trends in the deeper waters were generally more discernible, and indicated that (i) the health of the basins is generally better than in the rivers (and especially in the Murray River); (ii) the more tidally-flushed basin regions (northern Harvey Estuary, western Peel Inlet and, to a lesser extent, eastern Peel Inlet) are often in better health (good to fair, grades B–C) than the poorly flushed southern Harvey (fair to poor, grades C–D), and (iii) the upper Murray River appears to be in chronically poor ecological condition (grade D), characterised in most seasons by only two or three species which are either detritivores or opportunistic omnivores (Sea mullet, Perth Herring or Black Bream). The population status of the latter species, which is prized by recreational fishers, is also vulnerable due to poor recruitment of juveniles and low abundances of adults above minimum legal length at capture. These trends most likely reflect the susceptibility of the upper Murray to salinity stratification of the water column, high organic matter loading, and the persistent low dissolved oxygen levels that develop as a result. Finally, when FCI scores were statistically correlated with a suite of environmental variables, bottom water age, dissolved oxygen content and salinity were shown to have the greatest influence on ecological condition. In the deeper waters of the rivers, the best ecological condition occurred when dissolved oxygen content was highest and when the bottom water age was between 50 and 100 days. Poor FCI scores in this region occurred shortly after flooding (very low water age) and when bottom water became stagnant (water age &gt;100 days). In the shallow waters of the rivers increasing salinity had a weak positive effect on FCI scores, while in the shallow waters of the basins, hypoxia area (% of region with dissolved oxygen content &lt; 2 mg/L) had a weak negative influence. These quantitative responses of the FCI to specific environmental variables provides a basis for predicting the future ecological condition of the system under various environmental scenarios.

Meredith, PHCC). 2.2 Background Healthy, diverse and productive estuarine fish communities require good water quality, the availability of appropriate habitats and good connectivity between estuarine, marine and freshwater environments. Human activities can degrade estuaries and disrupt these requirements, resulting in the loss of particular species or groups (‘guilds’) of fish. Environmentally-sensitive fish species, including those that cannot tolerate widely ranging salinities or low levels of oxygen, or those with specialized feeding strategies or habitats, are typically lost first as estuary health declines (Fig. 1). Conversely, species that are highly tolerant and/or are more generalist in their requirements, can often dominate communities when the environmental niches previously occupied by less robust species become available. The structure of fish communities can therefore provide important signals about the ecological health of an estuary and the ways in which it is impacted by human activities, climate change and other pressures. Even though fish communities occupy higher ecological levels than other biotic indicators such as plankton or benthic invertebrates, they are known to be excellent indicators of estuarine condition (or ‘health’) since their component species vary widely in their (i) feeding levels (e.g. from primary to secondary consumers), (ii) habitat types (e.g. fresh to hypersaline waters, bottom-dwelling to open water, bare to vegetated substrates), (iii) the ways in which they use estuaries (e.g. nurseries to permanent residence) and (iv) life spans (e.g. one year to decades). Consequently, their ability to capture ‘signals’ from acute to chronic environmental changes, is vast (e.g. Whitfield and Elliott 2002; Pérez-Domínguez et al., 2012; Richardson et al., 2011). Figure 2.2: Conceptual diagram of predicted responses of the estuarine fish community to poor and good ecological condition (‘health’). Images courtesy of the Integration and Application Network, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (ian.umces.edu/symbols/). Reproduced from Hallett et al. (2019). Biotic indicators based on fish communities are now used to measure and monitor the ecological health of estuaries worldwide (Pérez-Domínguez et al., 2012; Martinho et al., 2015), although Australia has been slower to adopt this approach (Hallett et al., 2016). However, one fish-based indicator that has been developed specifically for south-western Australian estuaries is the Fish Community Index (FCI; Hallett et al., 2012b). The FCI integrates data on various characteristics (‘metrics’) of the fish community to generate ecological condition scores (0–100), which are then assigned to corresponding ‘report card’ grades (A, very good – E, very poor) that are easily understood by the wider community The FCI was originally developed for the Swan-Canning Estuary, where it has been used by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions for annual monitoring and reporting of estuary health since 2012. It has also been adopted in the Walpole-Nornalup Estuary by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (Fisheries) since 2017 (Hallett et al., 2019a; Yeoh et al., 2019). In this study, we aimed to adapt and apply the FCI to the Peel-Harvey Estuary to quantify patterns in its ecological health over the past four decades. We also sought to relate observed FCI scores to estuarine environmental conditions (as derived from the estuary response model developed in other parts of the Linkage Project; Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019b) to determine which elements were the key drivers of ecological health. It should be noted that while the fish communities of the Peel-Harvey Estuary have been studied periodically since the late 1970s, these surveys have typically differed in their sampling methods. Not only have different net types been used over time, but the fish communities in the tidal rivers and deeper waters of the estuary have been poorly studied. This study therefore involved an extensive fish sampling campaign to expand the collective fish data set for this system, and develop a fuller understanding of ecological health responses to environmental stressors. This campaign has also provided a good framework for designing a robust fish monitoring regime to allow the FCI to be tracked into the future. 2.3 Objectives Customize the Fish Community Index (FCI) to the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and calculate an ecological health ‘report card’ (grades A–E) for all historical (1979–2014) and contemporary (2016–2018) fish community samples collected throughout the system. Examine broad trends in estuarine ecological health over the last four decades (1979–2018) and finer-scale trends among estuary regions and seasons in 2016–2018. Compare observed FCI health scores to model-derived environmental data to identify the key environmental stressors of estuarine ecological health. Propose an ongoing fish monitoring regime for tracking the ecological health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary into the future. 2.4 Approach 2.4.1 Applying the FCI to the Peel-Harvey Estuary 2.4.1.1 Collection and collation of data All available fish community data for the Peel-Harvey Estuary were collated, comprising fish species abundances collected throughout the shallows and deeper waters of the basins and tidal rivers. These included historical data sets, collected by various Murdoch University researchers in select periods from 1979 to 2014, and those collected in the current study (2016–2018; Table 1, Fig. 2). Full details of the historical fish sampling regimes can be found in the published accounts of those studies (see Table 1). In the current study, fish were sampled throughout the estuary in eight consecutive seasons from autumn 2016 to summer 2018, typically in the middle month of each season. In the nearshore shallow waters (&lt;1.5 m deep), fish were collected using a 21.5 m long seine net during the day, while in the deeper waters (typically &gt;1.5 m deep), they were collected using multi-mesh gill nets at night. The dimensions and mesh sizes of these nets (see Hallett et al. [2012a] for details) were consistent with those used in several of the historical studies. All fish were immediately either identified to species or placed in an ice slurry and taken to the laboratory for subsequent identification. The total number of individuals belonging to each species in each sample was recorded. For historical samples collected using different seine net types to that used in the current study, all data were standardised (using a generalised linear modelling method as detailed in Hallett and Hall [2012]) to minimize the effects of varying net lengths and mesh sizes, and converted to number of fish 100 m−2. For samples collected with gill nets, all data were converted to equivalent catch rates (fish hr−1). Note that whilst these standardizations minimized (as far as possible) the effects of different sampling gear on fish abundances, some biases may remain (see Hallett and Hall, 2012). 2.4.1.2 Calculating the FCI for the Peel-Harvey Estuary Independent versions of the FCI were developed for assessing the condition of shallow and deeper waters to account for the marked differences in their fish faunas and the methods used to sample them (Hallett et al., 2019a). The metrics which comprise the FCI, and which are known to provide a robust basis for quantifying estuarine ecological health in south-western Australia (e.g. Hallett et al., 2016), are listed in Table 2. Figure 3 summarizes the process for calculating the FCI, which has been described extensively elsewhere (Hallett et al., 2012a; b; Hallett, 2014). The following subsections briefly outline this process, emphasizing the modifications used to customize the FCI for the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Firstly, all fish species in the collated and standardised data sets (section 4.1.1) were assigned to functional groups (‘guilds’) that reflected their habitat, feeding mode and use of the estuary (see Appendix 1). Values for each fish metric (Table 2) were then calculated for every fish sample collected in the shallow and deeper waters between 1979 and 2018. Figure 2.3: Map of the sites at which fish communities were sampled in the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1979–2018. Figure 2.4: Overview of the process for calculating the Fish Community Index. Values for each metric in each fish sample were then converted to scaled (0–10) scores, based on their deviation away from established benchmark values (‘reference conditions’). Note that these reference conditions were defined for each estuary region and season to account for natural spatial and seasonal variations in metric values (Hallett et al., 2012b). To derive the reference conditions, the best value recorded for each metric across all fish samples collected between 1979 and 2017 (hereafter referred to as the ‘training data set’), were used. Note that the data from the second year of contemporary sampling (2017–2018) was retained as a ‘validation data set’ for independent testing of the relationships between FCI condition grades and modelled environmental outputs (see section 4.2). Scaled metric scores were then combined to produce an index score (0–100) for each sample. Each index score was then compared to threshold values (Table 3), derived statistically from the distributions of all index scores in the training data sets (after Hallett 2014). This enabled the corresponding ecological health grade (A, very good, to E, very poor) to be determined for each sample. Intermediate grades (e.g. B/C, good-fair, or C/B, fair-good) were awarded if the sample index score was within one point of a grade threshold. 2.4.1.3 Exploring trends in the FCI To explore broad, long-term trends in the ecological health of the estuary, the mean FCI scores in the shallow and deeper waters were plotted in each fish sampling year from 1979 to 2018, both for the estuary as a whole and for the basin and river regions separately. To understand the fish species which were mainly responsible for driving observed trends in the FCI, complementary plots of species abundances across the whole community were constructed, as were plots of the mean number of species. These data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Anderson et al., 2008). To explore the current (2016–2018) ecological condition of the estuary in more detail, a series of maps were constructed showing the mean FCI in each region and season in the shallow and deeper waters. Note that this period included a large and unseasonal rainfall event in February 2017, which brought large amounts of organic matter and sediment into the estuary, followed by a sustained period of low to no dissolved oxygen in autumn 2017 that particularly impacted the upper Murray River region. 2.4.2 Relating estuary condition to modelled environmental changes We aimed to identify the key environmental drivers of estuarine ecological health (as assessed by the FCI) and, in particular, the environmental stressor thresholds that best ‘explain’ each of the ecological health classes (i.e. A, very good, to E, very poor). Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to relate observed FCI scores from 1978–2017 to a range of environmental stressor metrics derived from the coupled estuary response model developed in other parts of the Linkage project (see Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019b). These metrics included various water quality parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration) as well as measures of the frequency, severity, extent and/or persistence of stressors such as hypoxia, harmful algal blooms and ammonium concentrations. A detailed list of these stressors, which were calculated at both the site and estuary region scales, is given in Appendix 2. The GAMs analyses were conducted separately for the shallow and deep waters of the basins and the rivers. In each case, a suite of models were tested using many combinations of environmental metrics to determine the ‘best-fit’ model, or that which best ‘explained’ observed trends in the FCI scores. The above best-fit models were then used to predict FCI scores and condition grades based on known or modelled environmental data, allowing the ecological condition of the estuary to be estimated under any future environmental scenario. The reliability of these GAM predictions was tested by (i) predicting FCI scores for all sampling occasions in a validation data set (i.e. the FCI data recorded in autumn 2017–summer 2018), based on the modelled environmental stressor data, and (ii) comparing the predicted FCI grades with those calculated directly from the corresponding fish species abundance data. 2.5 Main Findings 2.5.1 Broad long-term (1979-2018) trends in estuary condition The ecological health of the shallows has improved from poor to fair in the rivers, but has remained fair in the basins over the last 40 years Plots of the mean FCI in each sampling season and year from 1979–2018 showed that, on average, the ecological condition of the shallow nearshore waters has improved slightly over time in the rivers (from poor, grade D, to fair, grade C), but has remained fair in the basins (Fig. 4a). As a result, the health of the shallows across the whole estuary has also apparently improved (Fig. 4b). Examination of the shallow water fish communities in both the basins and rivers shows that there has been a notable shift in the dominant species over time, and especially between the 1970s-1980s and later periods (see the shadeplots in Appendices 3 and 4; simply, the darker the shading, the more abundant the fish species). Whereas several species with freshwater affinities were abundant in the earliest period (e.g. River garfish Hyporhamphus regularis in both the rivers and basins, and Perth herring Nematalosa vlaminghi and Southwestern goby Afurcagobius suppositus in the rivers), they were either not recorded or were caught far less consistently in later periods. Instead, a relatively restricted suite of species, several of which have marine affinities or can withstand very high and variable salinities, have dominated the fauna from the mid-1990s onwards. In the rivers, these included the Elongate hardyhead Atherinosoma elongata, Wallace’s hardyhead Leptatherina wallacei, Weeping toadfish Torquigener pleurogramma and, in some seasons, Sandy sprat Hyperlophus vittatus (Appendix 4), while in the basins they included Weeping toadfish, Long-finned goby Favonigobius lateralis, Silverfish Leptatherina presbyteroides andElongate hardyhead. This ‘marinisation’ of the fish fauna, which was also reported by Potter et al. (2016), almost certainly reflects the increased tidal flushing brought about by the Dawesville Cut, combined with a drying climate. These factors have interacted to produce more stable, saline conditions that have pushed further upstream into the estuary over time (Huang et al., 2019). A similar marinisation trend has also occurred in the shallows of the Swan-Canning Estuary between the late 1970s and recent decades (Valesini et al., 2017). Another notable finding in the shallows of the basins, which was also identified by Potter et al. (2016) and further corroborated by the additional fish data collected in the Linkage study, is the return of abundant catches of various ‘weed-associated’ marine species since 2008, i.e. Western gobbleguts, Ostorhinchus rueppellii, Soldier fish Gymnapistes marmoratus and Western striped grunter Pelates octolineatus (Appendix 3). These species were also abundant in 1979-1983 when large blooms of green macroalgae blanketed Peel Inlet (Potter et al., 1983a, b; Loneragan et al., 1986). Their return in recent decades is likely to be related to the increases in seagrass and, in the southern Harvey Estuary, green macroalgae, that have been recorded over the same time frame (Valesini et al., 2019b). With respect to how these changes in the fish community have impacted the ecological health of the estuary, the main drivers of the improved FCI in the shallows of the rivers over the last few decades are the feeding, habitat and estuary usage guilds of the most dominant fish species (see the shadeplot of the FCI metric scores in Fig. 5, where green to white shades indicate better scores and red to black shades indicate poorer scores). Since the mid-2000s, more of the species that now dominate the fish assemblage (e.g. the hardyheads L. wallacei and A. elongata; Appendix 4) have specialist feeding strategies and/or are able to spawn in the estuary (i.e. metric trends which lead to increases in the FCI; see Table 2). In contrast, several of the more abundant species in the late 1970s (e.g. Perth herring and Yellowtail grunter Amniataba caudavittata) have generalist or opportunistic feeding strategies, or feed mainly on detritus (i.e. metric trends which lead to decreases in the FCI). Interestingly, however, some metrics showed a tendency to decline in health from the late 1970s to more recent periods. These included the prevalence of bottom-dwelling (benthic) fish, both in terms of the number of species and proportion of fish in the assemblage (although the latter also performed poorly in the early 1980s), as well as the overall number of fish species (Fig. 5). Another feature of the longer-term trends in the FCI is the greater inter-seasonal and inter-annual variability in the late 1970s/early 1980s compared to later decades (Fig. 4). This is very likely related to the far greater river inflows during that period, especially compared to the last decade. For example, the obvious drop in the FCI in winter 1981 to very poor (E) in both the rivers and basins (Fig. 4a), coincided with large flows from the Murray River compared to those in other sampling years in that period, i.e. 1979, 1980 or 1982 (Valesini et al., 2019a). Such large winter flushes often displace fish downstream (or out to sea), leading to low catches. The massive summer blooms of the toxic blue-green algae Nodularia spumigena in the Harvey Estuary in the 1970s/80s almost certainly would have further contributed to the observed variability in the FCI, particularly in the basins. Dense blooms of this microalgae, combined with related impacts such as deoxygenation of the water column as the blooms collapse, are well known to negatively impact the fish fauna in the estuary (Potter et al., 1983b). Further evidence of these impacts was that while the basin FCI was often highest in summer in sampling periods after the Cut (i.e. those from 1996 onwards), this was rarely the case in the pre-Cut periods (Fig. 4a).

Metric scores are shown on a coloured spectrum from red/black (poor scores) to green/white (excellent scores). The ecological health of the deeper waters has declined over the last 40 years In contrast to the trends in the shallows, the average condition of the deeper waters has worsened over the last 40 years (Fig. 6). This was especially so in the basins, which have declined from a good health status (B) in the 1970s/80s to fair/poor (C/D) in 2016–18 (Fig. 6a). The rivers have also declined, but only slightly from an average of C/D to D/C. The health trends in the deeper basins clearly reflect a shift in the fish fauna from one that was relatively species-rich, abundant and contained proportionately more benthic-dwelling and/or estuarine individuals (all of which positively influence the FCI; see Table 2), to one that is comparatively depauperate (with no fish being caught on several sampling occasions), sporadic and dominated by marine species (Fig. 7; Appendix 5). In the 1970s/80s, catches were regularly dominated by Estuary cobbler (which is able to spawn in the estuary and is also bottom-dwelling), other benthic-associated species such as Mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus, Roach Gerres subfasciatus, Yellow-finned whiting Sillago schomburgkii and Western striped grunter. Tailor Pomatomus saltatrix, and Yellow-eye mullet Aldrichetta forsteri were also abundant (Appendix 5). In 2016-18, however, catches were sparser and dominated only in particular seasons by Tailor, Australian herring Arripis georgianus, Southern eagle rays Myliobatis tenuicaudatus and Weeping toadfish, all of which are marine species. One metric that did show improvements from the earliest to latest sampling period was the proportion of fish feeding on detritus, but this mainly reflected the lower catches of Sea mullet Mugil cephalus in 2016-18 (Fig. 7, Appendix 5). The reasons for the decline in health in the basins are unclear, though may partly reflect the substantial decline in green macroalgae from the 1970s to 2018, especially in Peel Inlet (see Valesini et al., 2019b). Macroalgae provides abundant food and shelter for several of the above fish species, which are well known to be weed-associated, e.g. Estuary cobbler and Western striped grunter. Additionally, given that many of the fish species abundant in the earlier period feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, their decline over time may also reflect the poor health of those invertebrate fauna in the deeper basin sediments that we recorded in other parts of the Linkage study (see Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019). While there are no available data on the full invertebrate community in the deeper basins from the 1970s/80s, evidence from the shallows shows an obvious decline in these fauna from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s (Wildsmith et al., 2009). It is also possible that due to greater water clarity in the basins with the greater tidal influx since the Dawesville Cut, the gill nets used to sample fish in the deeper waters may be more visible and thus more easily avoided. Lastly, fishing pressure impacts on key fishery species such as Estuary Cobbler, Mulloway and Yellow-finned whiting cannot be discounted. Nonetheless, it is notable that the health of the deeper waters in the rivers has generally been poorer than those in the basins over the last 40 years. This mirrors the situation in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett, 2018), and probably reflects the greater vulnerability of these deeper areas to low dissolved oxygen conditions. Such ‘hypoxia’ is typically worse at the bottom of the water column given it is often related to salinity stratification, where saltier, denser waters fall to the bottom and are overlain by fresher, lighter water. It is also linked to poor river flushing, as waters retained in the estuary for long periods of time become depleted of oxygen due to consumption by biota and other biogeochemical processes. Both the stratification and flushing of the rivers are anticipated to worsen in coming decades given projections for further drying of the climate (Huang et al., 2019). Figure 2.7: Trends in mean Fish Community Index (FCI) scores and corresponding ecological health grades in the deeper waters from 1979-2018 in (a) the rivers (orange lines) and basins (blue lines) and (b) the Peel-Harvey Estuary as a whole. The dashed lines represent the line of best fit through the data. Figure 2.8: Shadeplot of the average FCI metric scores in the deeper waters of the (a) basins and (b) rivers in each sampling year and season (S, summer; A, autumn; W, winter; SP, spring) from 1979-2018. Metric scores are shown on a coloured spectrum from red/black (poor scores) to green/white (excellent scores). Interpretation of long-term trends in estuary health is hampered by inconsistencies in sampling approach among historical studies The above interpretations of the longer-term trends in the ecological health of the estuary should be considered indicative only, given the potential influence on the FCI of the differences in fish sampling methods over the last 40 years (see Table 1). While this historical fish community data set is the best available for the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and has been standardised as far as possible to minimize the effects of sampling differences (see section 4.1.1), it is inevitable that some legacy effects will remain. For example, fish in the shallows were sampled using far larger seine nets with bigger mesh sizes in the early periods, compared to the smaller and finer-meshed nets used in recent periods. These net differences invariably impact the ‘catchability’ of different fish species that may be present, given differences such as the extent from shore that can be fished, the speed with which a net can be retrieved, the efficiency with which different sections of the water column are fished, and which fish species can escape through the mesh. Hallett and Hall (2012) experimentally tested the efficiency with which the large (102 m) and small (21 m) seine nets used over the last 40 years in the Peel-Harvey caught different guilds of fish. They found, for example, that the larger net typically catches fewer of the smaller species and especially in the rivers (where the steeper banks reduce its fishing efficiency), yet often returns more species per haul given the potentially broader habitats it can reach. Differences between the gill nets used to sample the deeper waters in the 1970s/80s compared to more recent periods may have also impacted the comparability of those fish data sets. For example, gill nets used in the earlier period were a combination of floating and sunken nets, while those in recent sampling periods were only sunken nets and may have sampled pelagic species less effectively. Additionally, whereas nets were set for three hours in the 1970s–1980s, they could only be set for one hour in the more recent period given revised regulatory requirements and ethical considerations. While we have standardised both data sets to numbers of fish caught per hour, nets left in the water for longer periods simply have a greater likelihood of catching a greater number of species if they are present. Although our data standardization methods can adjust for the effects of net biases on the abundances of any fish species that was caught, it is impossible to adjust the abundance of a species that was never caught in a given fish sample. That is, there is no way of knowing whether the failure of a net to catch a species was due to the net type, or to that species simply not being present. Moving forward, it is thus strongly recommended that to avoid these sampling biases, a standardised fish sampling approach is used for monitoring the ecological condition of the estuary into the future (see section 5.4). A consistent fish sampling regime to support FCI monitoring has been undertaken annually in the Swan-Canning Estuary since 2012, and continues to be supported by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions in that system (Hallett et al., 2019a). A similar approach has also been adopted in the Walpole-Nornalup Estuary by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (Fisheries) since 2017 (Yeoh et al., 2019). 2.5.2 Current ecological condition of the Peel-Harvey Estuary (2016-18) The current overall health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary is fair to poor More detailed analysis of the FCI in each region and sampling season between autumn 2016 and summer 2018 showed that, on average, the overall health of the estuary in both the shallow and deeper waters was fair to poor (C–D; see grades in larger circles in Figs 8 and 9). Overall estuary condition was consistently best during autumn in both years and water depths (grade C), while the poorest grades were found in winter 2016 and spring 2017 in both water depths (grade D). In general, health grades were typically better in several of the basin regions than they were in one or more of the river regions. However, this was not a consistent trend, with regional patterns varying considerably among sampling occasions and water depths. For example, the shallow upper Murray River was in good to very good health (A–B) in autumn and spring 2017 and summer 2018, while the rest of the estuary was in fair to very poor health (C–E; Fig. 8). Further exploration of the complexity of these patterns in both the shallow and deeper waters is given below. Accompanying shadeplots of the metric scores in each region and sampling occasion are also provided for the shallows in Fig. 10 and deeper waters in Fig. 11. In the deeper basins, the northern Harvey Estuary and Peel Inlet is often in better ecological health than the southern Harvey Estuary Good to fair ecological health was commonly recorded in the deeper waters of the northern Harvey Estuary, western Peel Inlet and to a lesser extent the eastern Peel Inlet, whereas the deeper southern Harvey Estuary was often in fair to poor health; (Fig. 9). The higher FCI grades often reflected the presence of more species, as well as more trophic specialists and/or fewer detritivores in some seasons and/or regions (Fig. 11). Thus, while several species such as Tailor, Australian herring and Weeping toadfish were commonly caught across all basin regions, there were multiple marine species caught in the northern Harvey and Peel Inlet regions that were never or rarely caught in the southern Harvey, e.g. Black stingray Bathytoshia lata, Western shovelnose ray Aptychotrema vincentiana, Rock flathead Platycephalus laevigatus, Western Australian salmon A. truttaceus and King George whiting Sillaginodes punctata (shadeplots not shown). This undoubtedly reflects the ready access from the ocean to those northern basin regions via the Dawesville and/or natural entrance channels, as well as the more stable, marine salinities in particularly the western Peel Inlet and northern Harvey Estuary. Perth herring, which is a detritivore, was relatively abundant across the Harvey Estuary in some seasons, which in part probably reflects the high sedimentary organic matter levels throughout the deeper parts of that basin (Hallett et al., 2019b). However, it was proportionally more abundant in the southern Harvey, which would have contributed to the lower FCI scores recorded in that region. These findings may be indicative of the extensive green macroalgal growths that occur in the southern Harvey (Valesini et al. 2019b), and hence the abundant food sources for detritus-feeding fish species. In the deeper rivers, the upper Murray appears to be in chronically poor ecological health, while the Serpentine River is often in fair to good health The condition of the deeper waters of the upper Murray region was poor (D) in six of the eight sampling seasons, and never better than fair (C; Fig. 9). This commonly reflected the low number and diversity of species, low numbers of species with specialist feeding strategies, dominance of species feeding on detritus (detritivores) and relatively low representation by species that spawn in the estuary (see metric scores in Fig. 11). In most seasons, the fish community of this region was represented by just two or three species, the most abundant of which was Sea mullet (a detritivore that spawns in marine waters), followed by Black bream (a highly opportunistic omnivore) and Perth herring (also a detritivore; shadeplots not shown). Additionally, concurrent work on Black bream, which is a prized species targeted by recreational fishers that inhabits the riverine reaches of estuaries, has shown that its current population status in the Peel-Harvey is vulnerable. This is due to both very poor recruitment of juveniles into the stock since 2010, as well as low catches of adult fish above the State minimum legal length for capture of 250 mm (A. Cottingham, unpublished data). The virtual absence of these juveniles from the shallows of the rivers where they typically reside is reflected in Appendix 4, and contrasts with the higher numbers recorded in the previous sampling period in 2005–2007. Similarly, the abundance of larger fish in the deeper rivers has also declined from the previous 2013–2014 sampling period to the current one (Appendix 6), and a substantial number of the larger Black bream caught in 2016–2018 were in the lower Murray or Serpentine River (shadeplot not shown). Figure 2.9: One of the many Black Bream killed in the Murray River during the summer 2017 rainfall event (Photo, A. Cottingham). The poor ecological health of the deeper waters in the upper Murray likely reflects their susceptibility to stratification of the water column, and the persistent low dissolved oxygen conditions that develop as a result. The high levels of organic matter that accumulate in the deeper waters of this region (Hallett et al., 2019b) also accelerate the biological consumption of oxygen in the bottom waters. From summer to winter 2017 and again in summer 2018, the salinity at the water surface was 12-24 units fresher than at the bottom, and there was close to no dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters (concentrations of &lt;1 mg L‑1) on all four sampling occasions. A major fish kill event (&gt;10,000 fish) occurred in the Murray River during this period (summer 2017), triggered by an unseasonally high rainfall event and the extensive hypoxia/anoxia that developed as a result (see below). While the most visible impact of these events is on larger fish (with many dead Black bream observed; C. Hallett, pers. obs., and photo above), the impacts on earlier life stages and small fish are less obvious. In the case of Black bream, given that its typical spawning period (late spring-summer; Sarre and Potter, 1999) coincides not only with the acute episode in summer 2017, but also with the chronic stratification and hypoxia that develops at that time of year, it is very possible that its decline in the Peel-Harvey is due to the mortality of its eggs and/or young larvae under these conditions. In contrast to the deeper waters, the ecological health of the shallow upper Murray was good to very good in several seasons (autumn and spring 2017 and summer 2018; Fig. 8), which often reflected a prevalence of species with specialist feeding strategies, low contributions by detritivores, and low contributions by the indicator species Pseudogobius olorum (Fig. 10). These good metric scores were mainly driven by several smaller fish species that feed on small animals near the sediment surface (i.e. zoobenthivores), most of which have freshwater affinities, e.g. Southwestern goby A. suppositus, Western minnow Galaxias occidentalis, Western pygmy perch Edelia vittata, Mosquito fish Gambusia holbrooki (shadeplots not shown). Also in contrast to the deeper upper Murray, the deeper waters of the Serpentine River were in fair to good ecological health for five of the eight sampling occasions (Fig. 9). This was due mainly to good scores for metrics such as more specialist feeders rather than generalist feeders or detritivores, more bottom-dwelling species, and more species able to spawn in the estuary (Fig. 11). Its fish fauna was often characterised by marine-associated zoobenthivore or zooplanktivore species such as Tarwhine, Yellow-finned whiting, Roach and Southern anchovy, several of which are also benthic-associated. Commonly occurring estuarine-spawning species included Black bream and also Anchovy (shadeplots not shown). The better health of the deeper waters of the Serpentine likely reflects the shallower and more consistent depth of this river (with fewer deep holes where organic matter can accumulate), and its less variable and more marine salinities. In particular, the Serpentine River rarely exhibits the marked salinity stratification and associated hypoxia found in the upper Murray (unpublished data). The FCI successfully tracked the ecological impacts of the summer 2017 flood event On the 10th of February 2017, the Perth Metro area received a daily total of 114.4 mm of rain, its second highest daily fall for any month from records going back to 1876 (Bureau of Meteorology, 2017). The high river flows that followed created fresh conditions throughout the Murray River and delivered an enormous quantity of organic matter from the surrounding catchments into the estuary (see photo below). This was evident as a 10cm-thick layer of organic-rich silt and cow faeces during fish sampling in the lower Murray River on 16 February 2017 (pers. obs.). The combination of this organic loading and the highly stratified water column that became established in the following weeks and months led to severe hypoxia throughout the Murray River. Figure 2.10: Plume of organic-rich water from the Murray River (darker waters) spreading across Peel Inlet on 13th February 2017 During this period, both the shallow and deeper waters of the lower Murray region were in poor to very poor health, reflecting that either no fish were caught at all (deeper waters), or that the fish fauna contained only a limited number of species with ecological traits that decreased the FCI (shallows). Indeed the slightly higher grades in the shallows appeared to be artificially inflated by some larger species which normally inhabit the deeper waters of the lower Murray coming up on the banks to seek refuge (e.g. Tarwhine), and some species which normally occupy the more upstream river reaches being flushed down (e.g. the Southwestern goby). Another goby species which was relatively abundant in the shallows was the Blue-spot goby, which can tolerate silty substrates and survive hypoxic conditions through its capacity to ‘breathe air’ at the water surface (Gee and Gee, 1991). This ‘indicator’ species represents two metrics in the shallow-water FCI (Table 2), and its relative abundance would have contributed to the poor ecological health recorded in summer 2017. As well as tracking the immediate ecological health impacts of the flood in the lower Murray, the FCI also tracked impacts in adjoining regions such as the eastern Peel Inlet and Serpentine River. While the deeper waters of both of those regions were in ‘good’ health (grade B) in summer 2017 (Fig. 9), this was likely due in part to either the displacement of fish flushed out of the Murray River, or fish that were actively seeking refuge from inhospitable conditions. Tailor, for example, which was caught in the lower Murray in the warmer seasons of 2016–2018, was recorded for the only time in the Serpentine River in summer 2017 and was also relatively abundant in the eastern Peel Inlet. Similarly, Roach, which was frequently abundant in the lower Murray but less so in the Serpentine, became most abundant in that latter region in summer 2017. Tarwhine, which had also been abundant in the lower Murray in warmer seasons, became relatively abundant in the eastern Peel and to a lesser extent the Serpentine in summer 2017, then also returned to being abundant in the lower Murray in autumn 2017 (shadeplots not shown). These findings provide good evidence that the FCI is a sensitive indicator of ecological health shifts due to environmental perturbations such as acute hypoxic events. The ecological health of the shallow nearshore waters is inconsistent among regions, seasons and years It was difficult to discern many clear trends in the ecological health of the shallow waters (Fig. 8). Considerable variability has also been observed in the nearshore FCI scores in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett et al. 2019a), but generally less so than in the Peel-Harvey. The high variability in the shallows may in part reflect the fact that the bulk of the fish fauna are small, highly-schooling species (such as Hardyheads, Sandy sprat and Weeping toadfish) that can be caught either in very large numbers or virtually not at all, depending on whether a school is intercepted. The particularly shallow waters across large parts of the Peel-Harvey basins, where depths of &lt;0.5 m often extend a considerable distance from shore, may further contribute to the erratic nature of catches. For example, water quality conditions such as temperature can change quickly in the very shallow waters, and fish are also highly susceptible to predation by other fish or birds. One surprising trend that was relatively consistent in the shallows was the regularly poor to sometimes very poor ecological health recorded in the Mandurah Entrance Channel (Fig. 8). This well-flushed and essentially marine region, which is a conduit for many marine species moving between the estuary and the ocean, was expected to mainly be in good ecological health. However, it often scored poorly for metrics such as number of species and contributions by species that are benthic, specialist feeders and/or estuarine (Fig. 10). However, given that the reference or ‘benchmark’ conditions for the FCI metrics are (i) tailored to each estuary region and season and (ii) based on all available historical data (see section 4.1.2), examination of the fish community recorded in the Mandurah Channel over the full data record revealed some key reasons for the comparatively poor scores in 2016-2018. Several species which are specialist feeders, estuarine-spawners and/or bottom-dwelling, have dropped markedly in abundance from the 1970s/80s to more recent periods, e.g. Long-finned goby, Bridled goby, Small-toothed flounder and Sandy sprat (shadeplots not shown). Additionally Weeping toadfish, which are opportunistic omnivores, now make up a greater proportion of the fish assemblage than they did 40 years ago. The average number of species caught per sampling occasion has also declined progressively over time, from ~17 species in the 1970s/80s to ~7 in 2016-2018. While some of these trends may be influenced by differences in sampling regimes from the earlier to later periods (see subsection 5.1), the declines of several species that prefer sandy substrates (Long-finned goby and Small-toothed flounder) or seagrass (Bridled goby) could also reflect degradation of the channel environment from greater siltation and/or loss of key habitat. One obvious development between the 1970s/80s and more recent decades is the construction of the housing canals that now branch off and drain into the entrance channel, and which may have contributed to localised habitat changes.

NB condition assessments missing for some regions in first two seasons due to sampling issues. 2.5.3 Relating estuary condition to modelled environmental changes Bottom water age, dissolved oxygen and salinity have the greatest impact on ecological health When FCI scores were correlated with a suite of environmental variables, bottom water age, dissolved oxygen content and salinity were shown to have the greatest influence on ecological condition in the estuary (see Appendix 7 for GAM model descriptions). This correlation was strongest in the deeper waters of the rivers, where the best ecological condition occurred when water age was between 50 and 100 days (though it declined when water age exceeded 100 days) and when dissolved oxygen content was highest (Fig. 12). Thus, the poorest ecological condition occurred at water ages of &lt; 50 days and when dissolved oxygen content was low (&lt;2 mg/L). While this finding for water age may initially seem unusual, it reflects the fact that immediately flowing high freshwater flow events (very low water age) marine-associated fish species (e.g. Tarwhine, Tailor, Giant herring, Mulloway) are flushed downstream to more saline areas, thereby negatively influencing several FCI metrics (e.g. no. trophic specialist, no. species, Shannon-Weiner diversity) and resulting in decreased FCI scores. The robustness of this best-fit GAM model was tested by comparing actual FCI scores collected during 2017–2018, with those predicted based on the modelled environmental data during those sampling events. Observed and predicted scores were significantly correlated (Pearson R = 0.6, P &lt; 0.05) and, for 10 of the 12 sampling occasions, predicted the same FCI grade or overlapped the range of observed FCI scores (Fig. 13). One downside of the GAMs model, however, was that it generally over predicted FCI scores and so did not predict very low scores (i.e. grade E) very well (Fig. 13). In the shallow waters of the estuary, correlations between FCI scores and environmental variables were weaker, although salinity and the area of hypoxic waters (percentage of the region with dissolved oxygen content &lt; 2 mg L-1) were shown to significantly influence ecological health in the rivers and basins, respectively. In the rivers, increasing salinity had a weak positive effect on FCI scores, while in the basins, hypoxia area had a weak negative influence. No significant correlation between ecological condition and the tested environmental variables was detected in the deeper waters of the basins. This study represents the first time FCI scores and environmental variables (observed or model-derived) have been incorporated into statistical models to predict ecological health. Although the correlations were weak in some estuarine regions, the findings in the deeper waters of the rivers highlight the potential of this statistical modelling approach to predict future ecological condition in this vulnerable part of the estuary. More research is required to further explore the reasons underlying the poorer correlations in other parts of the estuary.

These options have been based on the outcomes of the current study, and informed by the design of a comparable ongoing monitoring regime in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett and Valesini, 2012). They include varying levels of spatial and temporal replication, depending on resource availability and monitoring objectives. Each of these options could (and should) be further tailored for purpose prior to implementation. 2.6 Conclusions The ecological health of the estuary has generally declined over the last 40 years, and is currently in a fair to poor state overall While the basins of the estuary are often perceived to be in ‘good’ condition following the Dawesville Cut and the resulting increase in tidal flushing and decline in algal blooms, the fish faunal trends in the deeper waters indicate otherwise. While they have certainly become more marine-influenced, they are also less diverse, less abundant, more sporadic and less specialised in their habitat requirements, and have declined from good overall health in the 1970s–1980s to fair/poor health in 2016–18. The current, overarching health of the estuary in both the shallow and deeper waters is fair to poor, relative to previously-recorded benchmark conditions. While there is considerable variability among regions and seasons, especially in the very shallow waters, the average ecological signal reflects an ecosystem under moderate to high levels of stress. The most impacted areas are the deeper waters of the upper Murray River and southern Harvey Estuary, and the shallows of the natural entrance channel The above areas currently appear to be in a chronically-stressed state and often exhibited poor to very poor ecological health via fish faunas that were either comparatively depauperate or dominated by a small number of species with less desirable ecological traits, e.g. opportunistic or detritus feeders. The ecological health signals from the fish communities align with those of the benthic invertebrate and macrophyte communities in the upper Murray and/or southern Harvey Estuary (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019; Valesini et al., 2091b). The convergence of each of these biotic indices, which each reflect different (albeit inter-related) aspects of estuarine structure and function, provides compelling evidence that the ecological health of those areas is under significant threat. Spatio-temporal patterns in FCI scores and grades reflect key environmental drivers Persistent bottom-water hypoxia and high organic matter loadings in the upper Murray are likely to be main drivers of consistently poor FCI scores, as are the relative lack of flushing and high organic loadings in the southern Harvev Estuary. It is predicted that low oxygen conditions in the Murray River will become more persistent in the future (Hipsey et al., 2019a; Huang et al., 2019), which, given the above findings, would be expected to result in further ecological degradation. Somewhat unexpectedly, substantial flushing in the rivers also caused a decline in FCI scores, which was likely due to avoidance of the area by marine-associated species and a resultant fish fauna comprised of only a few freshwater tolerant species (e.g. Sea mullet, Black bream). The surprising trends in the natural entrance channel may reflect an increase in silty sediments and loss of habitat (e.g. seagrass or saltmarsh) since the 1970s, possibly linked to localised developments such as the adjoining housing canals. Establishing a regular fish monitoring regime is critical to assessing and tracking measures to improve ongoing ecological health The historical fish faunal data set available for the Peel-Harvey has provided a rare basis for establishing fish metric benchmarks and exploring ecological health trends over time. However, the substantial inconsistencies in fish sampling approaches lead to inevitable biases that are at best minimised and in some cases are impossible to overcome, and cannot be disentangled from the historical health trends presented in this report. Given the evidence presented in this report that the ecological health of the estuary is under stress, it is imperative that a consistent and regular fish monitoring program is continued to better assess its ongoing health into the future. Various options for such a fish monitoring program, which can be tailored to suit, are provided in section 11 of this report. 2.7 Acknowledgements We are grateful to Dr Peter Coulson, Hannah Joss, Kieryn Graham, Chris Hill and Willem DeKlerk for their assistance with sampling and sample processing, and to the many researchers who shared their data from previous studies in this system.

Over more recent history, the macrophytes of the Peel-Harvey, and especially the green macroalgae, have been a major focus due to the massive blooms that occurred from the 1960s–1980s and the ecological and societal issues that resulted. Opening of the Dawesville Cut in 1994 to help alleviate these problems led to a major step change in the estuary’s hydrology and nutrient levels. There have also been other more gradual shifts in the estuarine environment from catchment development and climate change effects, particularly in recent decades. This report explores how the macrophyte community in the Peel-Harvey has changed over the last 40 years (1978–2018), and the environmental drivers that have been most influential. While other studies have examined changes in these plant communities in particular periods (e.g. just before and after the Cut), this is the first to examine the full sampling record. We also developed an index of macrophyte community condition or ‘health,’ which was translated into a report card scale from ‘A’ (excellent) to ‘E’ (very poor), and used it to track changes over time across the estuary. Lastly, we propose a macrophyte monitoring plan for the future. This report provides a broad summary of our key findings, and is supplemented by a more detailed and technical account in Krumholz (2019). Our findings show there have been dramatic changes in the macrophyte community from the late 1970s, which in most regions of the estuary has reflected major declines in green macroalgae and increases in seagrass. These shifts were most obvious just after the Cut and the subsequent boost in tidal flushing. The most recent survey results (2017–2018) show that, for the first time in the monitoring record, the community is clearly dominated by seagrass (70% of overall biomass in autumn 2018) as opposed to green macroalgae (52–86% of overall biomass from 1978–1994). This progression has led to improved health of the macrophyte community, from very poor to fair (index grade E–C) across much of the estuary in 1985–1989, to fair to excellent (grade C–A) in 2018. Figure 3.1: Green macroalage in the southern Harvey Estuary (Photo, O. Krumholz). One region of the estuary that is not showing signs of improvement is the southern Harvey Estuary. The macrophytes in this shallow and poorly flushed region remain in poor condition and are showing worrying signs with respect to increases in nuisance green macroalgae. While average green algal biomass decreased from the late 1970s to just after the Cut in this region, it has increased in more recent years, especially in spring when it far exceeds values recorded for any other macrophyte group across the whole estuary in the full 40 year timeframe. The shallow south-eastern Peel Inlet also has a high biomass of green macroalgae, again especially in spring, which has largely persisted throughout the monitoring record and even increased in recent years. The main environmental driver of the above longer-term shifts in the macrophyte community was the concentration of total nitrogen in the water column. Green algal-dominated assemblages were generally linked with higher nitrogen concentrations, and more seagrass-dominated assemblages were linked with lower concentrations. Some weaker correlations were also found with increasing salinities and temperatures, as well as decreasing total phosphorus concentrations. A more detailed study of the macrophytes across the estuary in spring 2017 and autumn 2018 found 23 species in total (over a third of which were red macroalgae), which has increased from the last comparable survey in 2009 (14 species in spring 2009 vs 18 species in spring 2017). Based on biomass, seagrass clearly dominates the 2017–2018 community (56% on average), most of which is Ruppia sp. and occurs mainly in the northern Harvey Estuary and parts of Peel Inlet. Not only has the seagrass contribution increased since spring 2009 (38% vs 60% in spring 2017), but the dominant seagrass species has changed from Zostera sp. to Ruppia sp. As for the long-term macrophyte data, the changes in the 2017–2018 community from more seagrass-dominated assemblages in the northern half of the system to a more green algal-dominated one in the southern Harvey Estuary, were best linked with an increase in total nitrogen, and to a lesser extent total phosphorus. To better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this macrophyte community, and if its recent move towards seagrass domination reflects a stable shift, it is imperative that a consistent and regular macrophyte monitoring program is implemented, alongside other environmental monitoring of the estuary. The broad monitoring regime we have proposed can be tailored to suit resourcing. 3.2 Background Macroalgal and seagrass communities are one of the most visual elements of the Peel-Harvey biota. These submerged plant communities (collectively referred to as ‘macrophytes’) play pivotal roles in estuarine ecosystems and are key indicators of environmental condition. Healthy macrophyte communities provide many ecosystem services, including supporting functions such as primary production and carbon sequestration, provisioning functions such as food and habitat for many fauna, and regulating functions such as sediment and shoreline stabilisation. These, in turn, support many societal values such as productive fisheries, wildlife watching opportunities and safer coastal environments that better mitigate threats such as bank erosion and flooding. Macrophytes are also good indicators of water quality, reflecting key aspects such as nutrient availability, salinity and turbidity. Seagrass-dominated communities, as opposed to those which are algal-dominated (and particularly by fast-growing green algae), typically reflect healthier estuarine ecosystems (e.g. Macreadie et al. (2017)). The Peel-Harvey became iconic throughout the 1960s–1980s for its extreme nutrient enrichment and associated macroalgal bloom issues (McComb et al., 1981). Thick blankets of green algae, dominated by Willeella brachyclados (previously Cladophora montagneana) and Chaetomorpha linum, covered Peel Inlet and some parts of Harvey Estuary, leading to massive accumulations of rotting weed. Seagrass also retracted due to algal smothering (Hodgkin et al., 1981; Bradby, 1997). The Dawesville Channel (‘Cut’) built in 1994 to help mitigate these algal blooms through increased tidal flushing certainly led to major shifts in the hydrology and nutrient levels of the estuary. Hydrodynamic modelling undertaken in other parts of the Linkage Project has shown, for example, that the Cut reduced water retention time in autumn from ~100 to 50 days in Peel Inlet and from ~150–200 to 50–80 days in Harvey Estuary (Huang et al., 2019). There have also been other, more incremental shifts in estuarine condition since the Cut opened 25 years ago, mainly through ongoing catchment development and climate change (Valesini et al., 2019). Under our increasingly drier climate, for example, water retention times have now increased back towards pre-Cut levels in some parts of the estuary (Huang et al., 2019). This study has collated existing long-term monitoring data of macrophyte biomass across the estuary basins, and undertaken new surveys of the macrophyte community, to produce a data set spanning four decades from 1978 to 2018. While there are several gaps in the monitoring record, this data provides a rare opportunity to explore how the seagrass and macroalgal communities of the Peel-Harvey have changed over the last 40 years, covering periods in the height of the macroalgal bloom issues, those just before and after the Cut, then more recent ones. Although some previous studies have examined changes in these plant communities in select years, e.g. before (1985–1991) and after (1994–1999) the Cut (Wilson et al., 1999), and in 2009 (Pedretti et al., 2009), this is the first to examine changes over the full sampling record, as well as statistically explore their environmental drivers. We also develop a simple index of macrophyte condition (‘health’), and propose a monitoring plan for the future. The specific objectives are as follows. 3.3 Objectives Characterise the long-term (1978–2018) shifts in the macrophyte community in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and determine any key water quality drivers. Characterise, in finer detail, the current (2017–18) macrophyte community throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Calculate a simple macrophyte condition index and explore its trends throughout the estuary over the last 40 years. Propose an ongoing monitoring regime for tracking macrophyte health throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 3.4 Approach 3.4.1 Long-term (1978–2018) trends in macrophyte communities and their drivers 3.4.1.1 Collating the long-term data sets Macrophyte biomass has been sampled in various years from 1978 to 2018 throughout the basins of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. To help with exploring long-term trends in the macrophyte community, sampling years were grouped into interannual ‘periods’, which typically contained four-six years, except in the more recent times when they contained one or two years. A summary of this long-term sampling regime is provided in Table 1 and a map of the sites that were sampled regularly is in shown in Fig. 1. This map also shows the estuarine regions (southern and northern Harvey Estuary; western and eastern Peel Inlet) and water depth category (shallow &lt;1.5 m; deep &gt;1.5 m) to which sites were assigned. Aside from 2017–2018, when sampling was undertaken as part of the current ARC Linkage Project (see section 4.2), all surveys were carried out by the Marine and Freshwater Research Laboratory (MAFRL) at Murdoch University (e.g. Wilson et al., 1999; Pedretti et al., 2011). Macrophyte surveys over the last 40 years have varied in the (i) frequency and timing during any one year (one–four times per year), (ii) number of sites sampled (30 to 51 sites) and (iii) resolution to which macrophyte taxa were identified, i.e. fine (species or genus ) vs broad (phylum or division; Table 1). To maximise data consistency between years, as well as the number of years that could be included for analysis, the data were harmonised in the following ways. As autumn and spring were the most frequently sampled seasons across years, only data collected at these times of year were used. Long-term trends were examined separately for each of these seasons because of differences in their sampling regimes (Table 1), and because macrophyte growth often changes seasonally in response to environmental changes. Only data collected from regularly sampled sites (i.e. visited in at least five of the sampling years) were included in the data set, i.e. those shown in Fig. 1. Only broad groups of macrophyte taxa (i.e. seagrass; green macroalgae; brown macroalgae; red macroalgae; charophytes) were examined across all sampling years, since this was the extent to which taxonomic classifications were consistently recorded from 1978–2000. In addition to the long-term macrophyte dataset, complementary data on various water quality parameters known to influence macrophyte growth (see below) were also collated from the weekly to monthly measurements made at six routine water monitoring sites throughout the estuary since 1977 by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) and other agencies such as MAFRL (see Fig. 1). Measurements recorded at the water surface and bottom for the following parameters were collated for each of the years and seasons (autumn and spring) in which macrophytes were sampled. Surface measurements were matched with nearby shallow macrophyte sites, and bottom measurements were matched with nearby deeper sites. Salinity Water temperature (°C) Turbidity, and particularly the extent to which light penetrates to the estuary bottom (reflected by Secchi depth scaled to a proportion of total water depth, i.e. 0, clear waters; 1, completely turbid) Total phosphorus concentration (µg L−1) Total nitrogen concentration (µg L−1) Additionally, to help with detecting any ‘growth response’ by the macrophytes to preceding water quality conditions, water measurements recorded over the two months prior to each macrophyte sampling event were also collated, and used to create a ‘time lag’ data set. Note that, due to some inconsistencies in the water quality monitoring record when not all of the above parameters were measured when macrophytes were sampled, some years had to be excluded from both data sets, i.e. 1978 in autumn and 1981 in spring (Table 1). Figure 3.2: Oliver Krumholz, coring for macrophytes (Photo, S. Cronin-O’Reilly). Figure 3.3: Map of the sites at which macrophytes were regularly sampled in the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1978–2018, and the stations at which water quality was monitored by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. Additional macrophyte sites sampled only in 2017–18 are highlighted, and the estuarine regions and water depths to which each site was assigned are also shown. 3.4.1.2 Field and laboratory methods At each field site on each sampling occasion, five replicate samples of the macrophyte community were taken by pushing a 9 cm diameter Perspex® core at least 10–15 cm deep into the sediment, then sealing it with rubber bungs to capture above and below-ground macrophyte biomass (Fig. 2). Figure 3.4: Example of a sediment core used to sample macrophyte biomass across the estuary (Photo, O. Krumholz). In the laboratory, all macrophytes in each replicate core were sorted into individual taxa, oven dried at 70°C, then the dry weights (g) of each taxon recorded. The resulting data from the five replicate cores were used to calculate the mean biomass of each taxa (weight per unit area; g m−2) at each site on each sampling occasion. Further details on field and lab methods can be found in Wilson et al. (1999), Pedretti et al. (2011) and Krumholz (2019). 3.4.1.3 Data analyses 3.4.1.3.1 Long-term macrophyte trends and links with water quality: Analysis of the 1978–2018 biomass data in each season focused on determining any changes in the macrophyte community between interannual periods, and the water quality drivers that were best correlated with any macrophyte shifts (both before and after a two-month time lag was applied to the water quality data; see section 4.1.1). Necessarily, these analyses also included other key elements of the sampling design, namely the estuarine region and water depth (shallow, deep) from which samples were collected, to account for any confounding effects. However, only those significant findings involving period differences were explored further. Most data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Anderson et al., 2008). Spatial interpolations of macrophyte biomass data throughout the estuary were undertaken in ESRI ArcMap v10. Details of all data pretreatments, statistical routines employed, test designs and routine settings are given in Krumholz (2019). Guides for interpreting the main outcomes of these analyses are provided in the ‘Main Findings’ section. 3.4.1.3.2 Macrophyte condition index: A simple index of the condition or ‘health’ of the macrophyte community, and thus the estuary, was calculated from the autumn data for all periods from 1978–2018. The premise of the index was that communities dominated by seagrass rather than green macroalgae reflect more desirable or ‘healthier’ estuarine conditions, with both the ratio and total biomass accounted for the assessment of macrophyte health. Broadly, the index was calculated by (i) determining the proportion of seagrass to green algal biomass in each field sample; (ii) weighting that proportion by the total biomass of seagrass and green algae (after it was standardised by the maximum value in the sampling record) and; (iii) placing all values on a common 0–1 scale then assigning them to five condition categories (1, ‘excellent’ to 0, ‘very poor’). Index categories were spatially interpolated throughout the estuary for each period using ESRI ArcMap v10. A full account of the methods for calculating and displaying the index are given in Krumholz (2019). It is important to note that the 0–1 index scale, and hence the condition categories, are relative to macrophyte trends observed only in the Peel-Harvey from 1978–2018. 3.4.2 Current trends in macroalgae and seagrass biomass (2017–18) The current macrophyte community was sampled in both spring 2017 and autumn 2018 at all 51 sites shown in Fig. 1. Several new sites were added to this sampling regime to improve coverage in certain sections of the estuary (see sites marked on Fig. 1). The field and lab methods were the same as those described in section 4.1.2, except that each macrophyte taxa was identified to species rather than broad phyla or division level as in previous surveys (Table 1). In contrast to the long-term macrophyte data set, the data analysis approach for the current data set focused equally on exploring the nature and extent of any differences in species biomass composition among estuarine regions, water depths and seasons. The same software as described in section 4.1.3 were used for these analyses. Full details of these analyses are given in Krumholz (2019). 3.5 Main Findings 3.5.1 Long-term (1978–2018) trends in macrophyte communities and their drivers Green macroalgae has decreased and seagrass has increased from 1978–2018, except in the southern Harvey Estuary where green macroalgae has increased Significant changes have occurred in the macrophyte community over the last 40 years (Fig. 3; Appendix 1). The extent of these interannual period changes has been substantial, especially in autumn when they were more influential than any macrophyte changes due to differences in estuary regions or water depth (Appendix 1). In general, there has been a clear decline in green macroalgal biomass over time, especially after the Dawesville Cut. Whereas green algae represented ~84% of the overall biomass in the late 1970s to mid-1980s (period 1), it was &lt;20% in the most recent period in autumn (period 5, 2018) and 43% in spring (period 4, 2009 and 2017). However, seagrass has increased dramatically post-Cut and more so in recent years, dominating overall biomass in autumn (~70% in period 5) and representing about half the biomass in spring (46% in period 4; Fig. 3). Inter-period shifts in the macrophyte community are shown in more detail for each region of the estuary in the ‘shadeplots’ in Fig. 4 (simply the darker the shading, the greater the biomass). Green algal and seagrass biomass are also interpolated across the whole estuary (based on site measurements) in Figs 5 and 6. In general, these plots show that reductions in green macroalgae over time have been most marked in Peel Inlet (in both the western and eastern sides in autumn and the western side in spring), while seagrass has increased most obviously in the northern Harvey, followed by Peel Inlet (Figs 4–6). Figure 3.5: Average contribution of each broad macrophyte group to the overall biomass in each period from 1978–2018 in autumn (top) and spring (bottom). The large shift in the macrophyte community following the Cut, especially in the northern Harvey and western Peel regions located closest to this channel, are also reflected in Fig. 7. Simply, years lying close together on these plots have more similar communities while those further apart have greater differences, and it was clear that there was a notable jump between pre- and post-Cut periods. While there was also a shift in the eastern Peel Inlet over time (mainly in autumn), it was a more gradual progression (Fig. 7). The macrophytes of the southern Harvey Estuary, however, have shown different long-term responses to other regions of the estuary. Although green algal biomass decreased from the late 1970s to just prior to the Cut in the early 1990s, it has again increased substantially in recent years (Figs 4–6). This was particularly so in spring, where green macroalgal biomass in period 4 (2009, 2017) was higher than that for any macrophyte group across the whole estuary in the full 40 year sampling timeframe. Additionally, seagrass in the southern Harvey virtually disappeared after the mid-1980s (period 1), which may in part reflect further smothering by the extreme blue-green algae blooms in the Harvey Estuary from the late 1970s–1980s (McComb and Humphries (1992)), combined with the particularly long water residence times in that poorly flushed part of the estuary (pre-Cut; ~150–200 days in autumn and ~50–75 days in spring, compared to ~100 and ~50 days, respectively, in Peel Inlet; Huang et al., 2019), which leads to other negative effects such as greater nutrient retention. While there has been a small (autumn) to moderate (spring) recovery of seagrass in the most recent period, it has not increased to the same extent as in other regions (Figs 4–6). It is noteworthy that, while water retention in the southern Harvey fell just after the Cut (~75 days in autumn and 25 days in spring), it is now returning back towards pre-Cut levels (Huang et al., 2019). The lack of clear directional changes in the macrophyte community of the southern Harvey from 1978–2018 is also reflected by the lack of separation of different periods on the plots in Fig. 7. Figure 3.6: Shadeplots of average biomass of each macrophyte group in each period (from 1978–2018) and estuarine region in autumn (top) and spring (bottom). Biomass is shown on a grey scale from highest biomass (black) to absent (white). *Average biomass values, which have been derived from the data recorded at each site, are presented on a pretreated (square-root transformed, dry weight g m-2) not raw scale. Figure 3.7: Average autumn biomass of green macroalgae (top) and seagrass (bottom) interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in each period from 1978–2018. Interpolated values were derived from the average biomass at each site in each period. Figure 3.8: Average spring biomass of green macroalgae (top) and seagrass (bottom) interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in each period from 1978–2018. Interpolated values were derived from the average biomass at each site in each period. Figure 3.9: Plots showing the relative similarity of macrophyte communities in each year (black labels) from 1978–2018 (years closer together have more similar macrophyte compositions) and each region during autumn (top) and spring (bottom). Consecutive years in each period are joined by colour-coded lines. Plots have been constructed using MDS ordination. Another (but lesser) exception to the general long-term trends across most of the estuary was the eastern Peel Inlet, especially in spring, where green algal biomass is still comparatively high (Figs 4, 6). Growths are particularly abundant in the shallow south-eastern corner, which has long been a ‘problem area’ for nuisance macroalgae, and appear to have increased from post-Cut periods to the most recent period in both seasons (Figs 5, 6). Given this area is very shallow and close to the mouth of the Murray River, the recurrence of high green algal biomass is not surprising following seasonal increases in temperature (and shallow waters that are quick to warm) and, especially in spring, a new flush of nutrients from preceding winter river flows. Across the broader eastern Peel region, there has been a slight decline in spring algal biomass since the mid-1980s (Fig. 4), which could reflect both markedly lower river flows (~50% drop in flow from the Murray sub-catchment since the 1970s; Valesini et al., 2019) and greater tidal flushing. Longer-term shifts in the macrophyte community show strong links with reductions in total nitrogen concentrations The distinct changes in the autumn macrophyte communities of the northern Harvey Estuary and western Peel Inlet from 1978–2018, especially after the Cut, were strongly linked with reductions in total nitrogen concentrations (TN) in the water column. For each of these regions located closest to the Cut, this was the case both when TN recorded close to the time of macrophyte sampling was correlated with the macrophyte data (BEST, P = 0.01, Spearman rank correlation [ρ] = 0.697 for Harvey north and 0.52 for western Peel), and after a two-month lag was applied to the water quality data to allow for a macrophyte growth response (BEST, P = 0.01, ρ = 0.668 for Harvey north and 0.44 for western Peel). This clear relationship can be seen in Fig. 8, which shows annual trends in the macrophyte community (black year labels) with the corresponding TN concentrations overlaid as circles of proportionate sizes. Note that, since trends in the ‘non-lag’ and ‘lag’ TN data were similar, only the former are shown. In both regions, the large macrophyte shifts in the post-Cut periods (4–5), which were due to declines in green algae and increases in seagrass (Fig. 4), were clearly linked with a large drop in TN from pre-Cut periods. Correlations between longer-term trends in the spring macrophyte communities and corresponding water quality parameters were also significant, but not as strong. In both the western and eastern Peel Inlet, moderate correlations were found when a combination of lag salinity, temperature and, for the western Peel, also total phosphorus concentration, was used (BEST, P = 0.001, ρ = 0.439–0.489). In general, the longer term changes in the macrophyte community (as shown in Fig. 7), were linked with increasing salinities and temperatures and decreasing total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (overlaid plot not shown). Average salinity across the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary has increased from ~26 in the pre-Cut periods, to ~32 from 1994-mid-2000s, and again slightly over the last decade (~33), reflecting additional influences of climate change such as reduced river flow (see earlier) and rising sea level (2.6 mm yr−1 from 1970). TP concentrations, like TN, fell rapidly following the Cut (annual TP averages of ~150 µg L−1 pre-Cut and ~50 µg L−1 post-Cut) and have continued to fall over recent decades (Valesini et al., 2019). Figure 3.10: Plots showing the relative similarity of macrophyte communities in each year from 1978–2018 (black labels; years closer together have more similar communities), with TN concentration overlaid as circles of proportionate sizes. Separate plots are shown for the northern Harvey and western Peel regions. Plots constructed using MDS ordination of macrophyte biomass composition data. The ‘health’ of the macrophyte community has improved in most regions of the estuary, but remains poor in the southern Harvey Estuary The current condition of the macrophyte community, as reflected by the scaled contributions of seagrass as opposed to green macroalgae, is the best that has been observed over the last 40 years in most areas of Peel Inlet and the northern Harvey Estuary, rating good to excellent (A–B) on the relative ‘health’ index scale. However, the communities in the southern Harvey remain in fair to poor condition (C–D; Fig. 9). Trends in the condition index from 1978–2018 show that, in general, the macrophyte community was at its least healthy in the mid to late 1980s, when it was fair to very poor across most of the estuary (Fig. 9). This mainly reflected a pronounced loss of seagrass across the system compared to 1978–1984, combined with green macroalgal biomass remaining relatively high (Fig. 5). Whereas the condition of the Peel Inlet macrophytes then gradually improved from 1990 to 2018, the condition of the Harvey Estuary (especially the southern region) continued to fall, reaching very poor status in 1995–2000, i.e. virtually no seagrass, but moderate levels of green macroalgae which had increased from just before the Cut (1990–1994; Figs 5 and 9). While green macroalgal biomass has continued to increase in the southern Harvey in recent years (2018; Figs 5 and 9), there has also been a small recovery of seagrass, leading to an improvement in the overall health score for this part of the estuary. The northern Harvey Estuary on the other hand has shown a striking improvement in macrophyte condition post-Cut, reaching ‘excellent’ status in 2018 and reflecting strong seagrass colonisation and a concurrent reduction in green algae (Figs 5 and 9). Figure 3.11: Macrophyte condition index categories interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in each period from 1978–2018. Index values have been calculated from data recorded in autumn in each sampling year. * It is important to note that the 0–1 index scale, and hence the condition categories, are relative to macrophyte trends observed only in the Peel-Harvey from 1978–2018. 3.5.2 Current trends in macroalgae and seagrass species composition (2017–18) The macrophyte community is dominated by seagrass, except in the southern Harvey Estuary Twenty three macrophyte species were found across the Peel-Harvey in the most recent sampling during spring 2017 and autumn 2018 (Appendix 2; Fig 10). Most of these species were red macroalgae (nine species), followed by green and brown algal species (six and four species, respectively), while three seagrass species and only one charophyte species were recorded (Appendix 2; Fig 10). The species richness of the macrophyte community has increased when compared to the only other previous study in the estuary in which all taxa were identified to species (i.e. Pedretti et al., 2011). Whereas 14 macrophyte species were found in spring 2009 (Pedretti et al., 2011), 18 were recorded in spring 2017 (Appendix 2). Based on total biomass at all sampling sites in both seasons, however, the current macrophyte community is clearly dominated by seagrass (56%), most of which is Ruppia sp. (44%) with smaller contributions by Halophila sp. and Zostera sp. (~11%; Appendix 2; Fig 10). Green macroalgae represent just over a third of the current biomass, with Willeella sp. (19%) and Chaetomorpha sp. (13%) being the most abundant in this macrophyte group. Despite being the most speciose group, red macroalgae made up only 5.5% of the overall biomass, and was represented mainly by Chondria sp. and Spyridia sp. Brown macroalgae and Charophytes contributed only a small proportion to the overall biomass, with the former comprised mainly of Hormophysa sp. and the latter entirely of Lamprothamnium sp. (Appendix 2; Fig 10). The dominance of seagrass in the current macrophyte community has developed only in the last decade. The survey by Pedretti et al. (2011) in spring 2009 showed that only 38% of the overall biomass was seagrass (as opposed to 60% in spring 2017 at the same sites), while 50% was green macroalgae (27% in spring 2017). Additionally, the dominant type of seagrass has changed. While Zostera sp. made up nearly half of the seagrass biomass in 2009 (and was found mainly in the northern Harvey and western Peel near the Cut; Pedretti et al., 2011), Ruppia sp. is now clearly not only the dominant seagrass, but also the most dominant taxa in the whole macrophyte community. Zostera sp. represented only 8% of seagrass in spring 2017, with its total biomass value being about a third of that found in 2009. When trends in the macrophyte community composition were tested statistically, significant differences were found between regions of the estuary and water depth, but not between seasons (Appendix 3). The seagrass Ruppia sp. was the dominant species in the shallows of all regions except the southern Harvey, where it was matched in terms of biomass by the nuisance green macroalgae species Willeella sp. and Chaetomorpha sp. (Figs 11–12 and photos opposite). The latter green algal species was also common in the shallows of eastern Peel Inlet. In the deeper waters, however, each of these three species were either absent or less prevalent. The seagrass Halophila sp. was instead relatively abundant in all regions except the southern Harvey, and Zostera sp. was also abundant in the western Peel. The red algae Chondria sp. made a moderate contribution to the macrophyte biomass in the deeper parts of Peel Inlet, while Chaetomorpha sp. dominated the deeper southern Harvey. Figure 3.12: Nuisance green macroalgae in the southern Harvey; Willeella sp. overlying black anoxic sediment (left) and Chaetomorpha sp. (right; Photos, S. Cronin-O-Reilly). Figure 3.13: Percentage contributions of each broad macrophyte group to the total macrophyte biomass (across all sampling sites in spring 2017 and autumn 2018) and the contribution of each species comprising each group. Figure 3.14: Shadeplots of average biomass of each macrophyte taxa in each region and water depth in 2017–2018. Biomass is shown on a grey scale from highest biomass (black) to absent (white). Average biomass values, which have been derived from the data recorded at each site, are presented on a pretreated (square-root transformed, dry weight g m-2) not raw scale. Figure 3.15: Average biomass of abundant macrophytes recorded in spring 2017 and autumn 2018 (seagrasses Halophila sp. and Ruppia sp. and green macroalgae Chaetomorpha sp.), interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Interpolated values were derived from the average biomass at each site in each season. Spatial trends in the current macrophyte community are best correlated with total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations The current macrophyte community shows a gradual progression in composition from the more marine-dominated northern Harvey Estuary and western Peel regions, where seagrasses Ruppia sp. and Halophila sp. dominate the shallows and deeper waters respectively (Fig. 11), to the eastern Peel Inlet and then southern Harvey Estuary, where green macroalgal species Willeella sp. and/or Chaetomorpha sp. are most abundant. Figure 13a summarises these trends, capturing the above compositional shifts (from left to right) in macrophyte samples averaged for each region and water depth. The distinction between the shallow and deeper macrophyte communities can also be seen (top vs bottom of the plot, respectively). These spatial changes in the macrophyte community were moderately well correlated with total nitrogen concentration (TN) in the water column (after a two-month lag was applied to the water quality data; BEST, P = 0.04, Spearman rank correlation = 0.351). This is also shown in Fig. 13, with the TN values overlaid on the macrophyte samples. Clearly, the progression from a seagrass to algal dominated community was linked with increases in total nitrogen. The higher nitrogen values in the surface than deeper waters, especially in both Peel regions in spring 2017, most likely reflect nutrient flushes into the estuary from the preceding winter river flow. Similar relationships were found between the macrophytes and total phosphorus (TP) concentration when the data sets were correlated at a finer spatial (site × depth) resolution (Fig. 13). Although the correlation was quite weak (BEST, P = 0.05, Spearman rank correlation = 0.19), it was clear that the green-algal dominated macrophyte samples from the southern Harvey were linked with notably higher TP concentrations (Fig. 13). Figure 3.16: Plots showing the relative similarity of macrophyte communities during 2017–18 in (a) each region (colour coded) and water depth (white labels; s=shallows; d=deeper) and (b) each site and water depth. Samples closer together have more similar communities. The values of (a) total nitrogen concentration (with a two-month time lag) and (b) total phosphorus concentration, have been overlaid as circles of proportionate sizes. Plots constructed using MDS ordination of macrophyte biomass composition data. 3.6 Conclusions The macrophyte community has changed over time, and mostly for the better The macrophyte community of the Peel-Harvey Estuary has changed significantly from 1978–2018 from one dominated by green macroalgae (late 1970s to at least the early 2000s) to one dominated by seagrass (possibly in the last decade, but more likely only in the last five years). Based on the index of macrophyte condition (and by extension, estuarine ecosystem health), the above changes correspond with a change from fair–very poor (index grade C–E) throughout much of the estuary in 1985–1989, to fair to excellent (index grade C–A) in 2018. The macrophyte community in the southern Harvey, however, continues to be dominated by green algae (‘poor’ condition in 2018) and is showing worrying trends. While some seagrass is now growing in this region after its complete loss from the mid-1980s to early 2000s, green algae still dominates and has increased in biomass since the last (2009) survey. This is particularly true of the nuisance species Willeella brachyclados, which is only abundant in this region. High green macroalgal biomass also still persists in the shallow south-eastern corner of Peel Inlet. Nutrient concentrations are the main drivers of observed long-term and current changes in the macrophyte community The main environmental drivers of both the long-term (1978–2018) and current (2017–2018) trends in the macrophyte community are either total nitrogen or total phosphorus concentration in the water column. Broadly, shifts from green macroalgal to seagrass-dominated communities were linked with clear reductions in nutrient availability. Despite the marked changes in various other examined water quality variables following the Cut, as well as further incremental shifts with climate change (i.e. increasing salinities, temperatures and water clarity; Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019; Valesini et al., 2019), the strongest and most convincing correlations were still found with changes in the above nutrient concentrations. Continuing and standardising the macrophyte monitoring regime is fundamental for assessing ongoing macrophyte health and better understanding key drivers The 1978–2018 macrophyte biomass record for the Peel-Harvey Estuary is a rare biotic data set that has enabled exploration of long-term changes in the macrophyte community. Yet, it has several limitations that preclude a more thorough understanding of macrophyte trends, including inconsistencies in the level of taxonomic identification (and hence only broad groups for most of the data) and the number of sampling sites and seasons. There are also large gaps between some consecutive surveys, including between the current 2017–2018 survey and the previous one in 2009. Additionally, biomass only captures one perspective of the plant community, whereas others such as spatial cover are also important. To better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this macrophyte community, and determine if its recent move towards seagrass domination reflects a stable shift, it is imperative that a consistent and regular macrophyte monitoring program is continued into the future. A broad program for future monitoring of the Peel-Harvey seagrass and macroalgal communities is proposed in Table 2. This program is purposely broad, outlining the main macrophyte components to be monitored and suggested methods. Finer details for implementing this program will need to be determined, following clarity in level of interest in uptake and resourcing. 3.7 Acknowledgements We are particularly grateful to the Marine and Freshwater Laboratories at Murdoch University for generously sharing the historical macrophyte data they had collected across the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1978–2009.

Its rivers drain extensively cleared catchments and have long brought large quantities of organic matter, fine sediments (mud) and dissolved nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, into the system. These inputs impact the condition or health of the estuarine sediments, including their particle size and porosity, oxygen content and nutrient processing abilities. In turn, these changes can degrade water quality, impact biota that live on or in the sediments, and subsequently, lead to a host of diminished societal benefits from the estuary. The enrichment and resulting health of the sediments in the Peel-Harvey have long been of interest, with the first intensive surveys conducted in the 1970s and highlighting high levels of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus throughout large parts of the basins. More recently, concern has been growing over the extent and impacts of fine sulfidic sediments, or so-called monosulfidic black oozes. Despite these concerns, two decades have passed since the last broad-scale survey of sediments in the estuary, and the condition of sediments in the estuary’s rivers, in particular, has been poorly documented. This study aims to address these gaps in our current understanding of sediments throughout the estuary, and particularly to assess the impacts of enrichment on the health of its sediments. Specifically, we describe and test a novel approach (a ‘Rapid Assessment Protocol’ or RAP) for quickly and cost-effectively scoring sediment condition based on its colour, texture and odour, which could be used for future monitoring of sediment health in this system. The accuracy of the RAP was verified by comparing it to various detailed sediment enrichment attributes that we measured from samples collected across the estuary basins and rivers. This report provides a broad summary of our key findings, and is supplemented by a more detailed and technical account in Hallett et al. (2019). Our findings show that the RAP provides an excellent measure of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey, with a particularly high success rate (&gt;88%) of identifying ‘good’ sites with low enrichment. Sediments throughout large parts of the system are moderately to highly enriched with carbon and nitrogen, particularly in the deeper, muddier waters of the Harvey Estuary, which negatively impacts their condition. Sites with low levels of enrichment were typically coarse-grained, well oxygenated sands with little to no odour of hydrogen sulfide, and were mainly found in the shallower, nearshore waters of the basins and the middle to lower reaches of the rivers. In contrast, highly enriched, poor condition sediments were typically oozy, grey/black muds with little to no oxygenated layer and a moderate to strong hydrogen sulfide odour. The unhealthiest sediments (monosulfidic black oozes) were found in the Yunderup Channel, the southeast corner of Peel Inlet and the upper estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers. More detailed investigations of the sediments in navigation channels and other depositional areas in the estuary, using the RAP described here, are recommended to better understand flow-on effects for broader estuary health. To better assess the ongoing health of sediments throughout the estuary, and how activities such as dredging may impact sediment and broader estuarine health, we recommend that a consistent and regular sediment monitoring program is implemented alongside other environmental monitoring of the estuary. The RAP that we have developed, with its simple scoring system and predictive framework for classifying the sediment condition of any new site, provides a cost-effective tool for such monitoring. 4.2 Background The enrichment of sediments with nutrients and organic matter is a key stressor of the health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary, as is the case for many eutrophic estuaries throughout the world. This predominantly reflects the extensively cleared river catchments that drain into the estuary, bringing large inputs of organic matter, fine sediments (mud) and dissolved inorganic nutrients including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from surrounding agricultural and urban areas (McComb and Humphries, 1992; Kelsey et al., 2011). The resulting enrichment can impact the condition of sediments, their biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling processes (Fig. 1; Burdige, 2011), and thereby the ecology and ecosystem services they support (Hale et al., 2016). Organic matter is decomposed by microbes in the sediment, increasing sediment oxygen demand and creating hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) conditions. Enriched, hypoxic sediments typically act as sources of inorganic nutrients such as phosphates and ammonium to the water column, potentially stimulating harmful algal blooms (Conley et al., 2007). They can also accumulate toxic hydrogen sulfide, leading to impoverished benthic faunal communities living in or on the sediment (Kanaya et al., 2016). At the extreme end of the enrichment continuum are anoxic, organic-rich muds known as monosulfidic black oozes (MBO), which occur in parts of the Peel-Harvey Estuary (Kraal et al., 2013a). These sediments can be a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and may have significant negative ecological impacts when disturbed (Sullivan et al., 2002). A key challenge for estuary managers and scientists, which this study aimed to tackle, is how to quantify and monitor sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey in a timely and cost-effective manner. Intensive studies in the late 1970s to late 1980s revealed high concentrations of P, N and organic matter in surface sediments of the Peel-Harvey (Gabrielson, 1981; McComb et al., 1998). Contrary to expectations, a subsequent study in 1998 following the opening of the Dawesville Cut found little change in sediment nutrient or organic matter concentrations from pre- to post-Cut periods. More recently, concern has also been growing over the extent and potential impacts of fine sulfidic sediments (MBOs) in the estuary, and particularly around the consequences of dredging these muds during maintenance operations (Valesini et al., 2019a). Despite these concerns, it has been almost two decades since the last broad-scale survey of sediment condition and biogeochemistry throughout the estuary. Most previous studies have also focused on the estuary’s basins, with only limited surveys in the rivers. Our study sought to address these knowledge gaps by developing and validating a rapid and cost-effective approach for measuring sediment condition that could support a future monitoring plan. We undertook a broad-scale survey of sediments at almost 100 sites throughout the estuary basins and rivers in November-December 2016. We collected (i) scored data on sediment colour, texture and odour; (ii) quantitative measurements of sediment enrichment (total carbon, TC; organic carbon, OC; total nitrogen, TN) and grain size, and (iii) C and N isotopes, to better understand how human activities may have impacted the estuary via chronic or acute enrichment. This sediment data also provided key ‘base layers’ for the estuary biogeochemical model developed in other parts of the Linkage Project (see Hipsey et al., 2019). The specific study objectives were as follows. 4.3 Objectives Develop and apply a simple and rapid approach (a Rapid Assessment Protocol; RAP) for characterizing sediment condition, based on scores for sediment colour, odour and texture, throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Evaluate whether the RAP condition scores reliably reflect the extent of sediment enrichment, as determined by complementary, detailed measurements of TC, OC and TN throughout the estuary. Quantify the influence of water depth, %mud and enrichment on sediment condition, and summarise these relationships via spatially interpolated maps. Use complementary sediment isotope data to identify zones of chronic vs. acute nutrient enrichment. Figure 4.1: Core with oxygenated sediment (grey/ brown) and anoxic sediment (black) (Photo, C. Hallett). Figure 4.2: Conceptual model of the effects of progressive enrichment with organic matter (OM) and nutrients on sediment condition and biogeochemistry (from Hallett et al., 2019). Increasing enrichment leads to declining sediment condition, including a shift from (a) oxic to (c) anoxic conditions. This disrupts nutrient cycling between the sediment and overlying water and leads to the accumulation and potential release of inorganic nutrients (ammonium, phosphates) and toxic sulfides. (aRPD – apparent Redox Potential Discontinuity, which reflects depth of oxygen penetration into the sediment). 4.4 Approach 4.5 Rapid Assessment Protocol for evaluating sediment condition 4.5.0.1 Sample collection A wide-scale sediment collection program was undertaken across 97 sites throughout the estuary during November-December 2016, comprising 62 sites in the basins (Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary) and 35 sites across the estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers (Fig. 2). At each site, two replicate, intact sediment cores were collected using a corer with a detachable, transparent PVC tube (600 mm long and 60 mm in diameter). The intact cores were then briefly stored in the dark until processed as described below. Water depth (m) was also recorded at each site. 4.5.0.2 Rapid assessment of sediment condition characteristics A rapid, semi-quantitative assessment of sediment condition was undertaken on each replicate core, based on sediment colour, texture and odour. Each of these characteristics was scored from 0–5 (Table 1), reflecting poor to good sediment condition as outlined in Fig. 1. The scores for these three RAP variables were then summed to provide a total RAP score (0–15) for each core. Scores for replicate cores were then averaged to generate site-level RAP scores for data analysis. Further details on the RAP approach and all of the following analyses can be found in Hallett et al. (2019). 4.5.0.3 Quantitative assessment of sediment enrichment and other parameters In the field, pooled subsamples of sediment were collected from each pair of replicate cores and stored at −18 °C prior to subsequent analysis. Sediments within 2 cm of the sediment surface were analysed for %TC, %OC, %TN and stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ15C) using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and those within 5 cm of the surface were analysed for particle size composition using a hydrometer. For particle size, the masses of each sample comprised of gravel (&gt;2 mm), sand (50 µm–2 mm), silt (2–50 µm) and clay (&lt;2 µm) were expressed as percentages, then the silt and clay fractions were combined to produce a measure of the fine sediments at each site (%mud). Full details of the laboratory analyses are provided in Hallett et al. (2019). For details on the isotope analyses see Smith et al. (2016). Figure 4.3: Map of the sites at which sediments were sampled in the Peel-Harvey Estuary in 2016. 4.5.0.4 Data analyses The following briefly summarises the intent of the main statistical analyses of the sediment data. Hallett et al. (2019) describes in detail all data pretreatments, statistical routines employed, test designs and routine settings. Most data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Anderson et al., 2008). Spatial mapping of sediment parameters and RAP results throughout the estuary were undertaken in QGIS 2.18. Guides for interpreting the main outcomes of these analyses are provided in the ‘Main Findings’ section. All sites were firstly statistically classified into sediment enrichment classes (Low, Medium, High) based on their %TC, %OC and %TN measurements. The extent to which the RAP scores (collated from sediment colour, texture and odour) differentiated among sites assigned to the three enrichment classes was then tested. As these tests showed an excellent alignment between sediment enrichment and RAP condition, all sites were then classified into sediment condition classes (Good, Fair, Poor). To broaden the usefulness of the RAP approach beyond the current study, easy-to-use ‘decision trees’ were developed for predicting the condition class of any new site in this system based solely on its RAP scores for colour, texture and/or odour. Separate analyses were undertaken for river and basin sites to account for natural regional variation in sediment colour, texture and odour. Finally, the influences of water depth, %mud and enrichment on sediment condition were quantified, and summarised using spatially interpolated maps. 4.6 Main Findings 4.6.1 Evaluating the Rapid Assessment Protocol for sediment condition The RAP is an accurate and cost-effective measure of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition Sites throughout the estuary differed widely in their sediment enrichment (organic matter and nutrients) and mud contents. Sediment TC, most of which comprised OC (a proxy for organic matter), ranged from 0.07-7.85%, whilst TN ranged from 0.01-0.90%. The mud content of sediments ranged from 1-86%, with a mean of ~29%. Statistical clustering of these enrichment measurements at the 97 sites surveyed (see Hallett et al., 2019) resulted in three, highly distinct groups of sites representing Low enrichment (59 sites), Medium enrichment (34 sites) and High enrichment (4 sites) classes. Sites in the High enrichment class had enrichment levels 10–15 times higher than those of the Low class (based on median values for TN, TC and OC; Fig. 3). Figure 4.4: . Box and whisker plots of %TN, %TC and %OC values across all Low, Medium and High enrichment sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Horizontal lines in each box represent median values, and whisker endpoints are high/low extreme values. With respect to the sediment attributes that were scored using the RAP, very clear differences in colour, texture and odour were observed among sites (Fig. 4). Based on their scores across these three attributes, 35, 25 and two sites of the 62 surveyed across the basins were classed as in Good, Fair and Poor condition, respectively. Among riverine sites, 27 were in Good condition, six were Fair and two were Poor. The patterns in RAP scores among these condition classes differed slightly between basin and river sites. In the basins, colour and texture scores declined consistently from Good (median scores of 4) to Poor (median scores of 0), as did total RAP scores (Fig. 5a). In contrast, riverine sites in Fair and Poor condition showed similarly low colour and texture scores (median ≤1) and total RAP scores (Fig. 5b). Low odour scores were largely restricted to basin and river sites in Poor condition (medians of 1.5 and 1, respectively). Figure 4.5: Cores of sediments classified as (a) Good, (b) Fair and (c) Poor condition based on their Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) scores for sediment colour, texture and odour. Figure 4.6: Box and whisker plots of sediment colour, texture, odour and total Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) scores among sites classified as being in Good, Fair and Poor sediment condition, across (a) basins and (b) rivers. Horizontal lines in each box represent median values, and whisker endpoints are high/low extreme values. The RAP was shown to provide a highly useful proxy for assessing the degree of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition throughout the estuary. A summary of the statistical method used to test this relationship is shown in Fig. 6, with the key outcomes of the test (known as ‘Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates,’ or CAP) as follows. A guide for interpreting the CAP plot is given below, and further details are in Hallett et al. (2019). There was a strong association between the RAP scores of sediment condition and the quantitative enrichment classes (low, medium and high), i.e. correlations of 0.62–0.78. Sites grading from low through to high enrichment were best explained by differences in sediment texture (grading from grainy sands to oozy muds) and colour (grading from yellow/brown to black), with high enrichment sites also being particularly linked with strong odours. RAP scores differed significantly among the enrichment classes, and correctly identified the right enrichment class for sites ~84% of the time. The RAP was particularly successful (&lt;12% misclassification rate) at identifying sites with low enrichment, demonstrating its promise as a first-pass survey approach for identifying ‘least impacted’ reference or control sites to support future impact assessments. Broadly, to interpret the CAP plot in Fig. 6: (1) the points on the plot represent the survey sites, which are each colour-coded by their enrichment class (low, medium and high) and labelled with their condition class (black labels; good, fair and poor) – simply, sites lying close together on the plot have more similar condition and enrichment characteristics than those further apart; (2) site differences in sediment condition and enrichment were well ‘explained’ by two main gradients – the horizontal axis (CAP1) and vertical axis (CAP2). The blue lines (vectors) overlaid on the plot show the roles played by each of the RAP characteristics in helping to explain those site differences. Thus, sites grading from low to high enrichment (and good to poor condition) from left to right along CAP1 were associated strongly with decreasing RAP scores for sediment texture and colour (i.e. vector lines lying mainly parallel to CAP1) and to a lesser extent odour (vector line at a sharper angle to CAP1). Moving from the bottom to the top along CAP2, the greatest separation of sites was seen for those in the high enrichment class. The RAP vector most strongly linked with this separation was odour, reflecting stronger smelling sediments in the high enrichment class. Figure 4.7: Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) plot, with the 97 sites coded by symbols for their enrichment class and labelled with their Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) condition class (G–Good, F–Fair, P–Poor). Note that several sites overlap on the plot. Vector lines (in blue) overlaid on the plot indicate the strength and direction of the correlations between each RAP variable (colour, texture and odour) with the CAP axes. The RAP can predict the sediment condition of any new site Given the above validation that the RAP accurately reflects sediment enrichment and broader sediment condition, easy-to-use decision trees were then generated to enable any investigator to reliably predict the sediment condition class of any further basin or river site in the Peel-Harvey based solely on its observed RAP scores. These decision trees (produced statistically by a regression tree approach; see Hallett et al., 2019) are shown in Fig. 7 below. To use these trees, the RAP scores of any new sediment sample are simply compared to the thresholds at each branch of the tree, starting at the top, then taking a left path if the non-bracketed criteria are true, or a right path if the bracketed criteria are true. Figure 4.8: Decision trees for assigning new (a) basin and (b) river sites in the Peel-Harvey Estuary to their appropriate sediment condition class (bold text at terminal nodes) based on their Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) score thresholds. Unbracketed and bracketed thresholds at each branch indicate that a left and right path, respectively, should be followed through the tree. (Trees were constructed using LINKTREE and SIMPROF routines. B% reflects the extent of class differences). The decision tree for basin sites indicated that Poor sediment condition would be predicted for any future site with odour scores of ≤2 (i.e. moderate to strong smell of hydrogen sulphide, or ‘rotten egg gas’; Table 1), or colour or texture scores of 0 (black oozy muds; Table 1, Fig. 7a). Separation of basin sites with Fair or Good sediment condition mainly depends on whether their texture score was ≤2 or ≥3, respectively (i.e. smooth to oozy muds vs. grainy sands). Among river sites, Good sediment condition would be predicted for those with texture scores of ≥2 and colour scores of ≥1.5, and Poor condition for sites with odour scores of ≤2 or texture scores of &lt;1 (Fig. 7b). These decision rules were used to determine the condition of sediments at a further 120 sites throughout the Peel-Harvey in 2017–18, to help quantify the ecological responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to sediment stressors and subsequently establish a new biological index of estuarine condition (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019). Given the speed and low resource costs of applying the RAP decision rules, they could clearly provide a robust, consistent and cost-effective approach for future monitoring of sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey (see section 6). Sediments in the deeper parts of the Harvey Estuary are generally muddier, more enriched and in poorer condition than those in the Peel Inlet In general, the least enriched sediments were located around the edges of the estuary basins, and particularly in the well-flushed western Peel Inlet and northern-most Harvey Estuary, whereas the more central parts of the basins tended to be more enriched (Fig. 8). Harvey Estuary sediments were notably more enriched than those in Peel Inlet, although the south-eastern corner of Peel Inlet was also a hotspot of enrichment. Much of the sediment in the rivers was moderately to highly enriched, with the highest levels typically seen among sites further upstream. These patterns in enrichment were generally mirrored by those in sediment condition, with more enriched sites often exhibiting poorer condition. Spatial interpolations of water depth, sediment mud content and enrichment parameters help to illuminate the effects of both natural and human influences on patterns in sediment condition throughout the estuary. Deeper, central parts of the estuary basins generally exhibited Fair sediment condition, in contrast to the Good condition of many sites on the shallower margins (Fig. 9a). This generally reflected higher mud contents at the deeper basin sites, but particularly at those in the Harvey Estuary (&gt;60% mud; Fig. 9b), where levels of enrichment were notably higher (Fig. 9c, d). These patterns were confirmed by statistical tests (distance-based linear modelling), which revealed that enrichment alone explained the largest proportion of the variability in RAP scores (57% among basin sites and 52% among river sites; Appendix 1). Enrichment was significantly associated with poorer sediment condition among river and basin sites, irrespective of their mud content. Nonetheless, enriched sediments were particularly likely to exhibit poorer condition if they were also muddier, which in the case of basin sites was associated with greater water depths. These relationships reflect the clear effects of enrichment, and associated muddying, on the physical and biogeochemical characteristics, and therefore condition, of sediments. Accumulation of OM and nutrients, often in conjunction with increased fine particles (mud), alters the physical and biogeochemical properties of sediments, including their porosity, oxygenation status and nutrient cycling processes (Fig. 1; Eyre and Ferguson, 2009, Valdemarsen et al., 2010). These changes manifest as changes in sediment texture, colour and odour (Rosenberg et al., 2001, Hargrave et al., 2008), which the RAP summarises via a semi-quantitative scoring system. Figure 4.9: Map of overall sediment enrichment (TC, OC and TN) interpolated throughout the estuary. Circles denote sediment sampling sites, colour coded by their sediment condition class (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor). Insets provide higher resolution views of patterns in the rivers. Figure 4.10: Maps of (a) water depth, (b) %mud, (c) %OC, (d) %TN interpolated throughout the estuary. Circles denote sediment sampling sites, colour coded by their sediment condition class (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor). Insets provide higher resolution views of patterns in the rivers. The proportion of mud, which varies naturally with water depth, influences sediment enrichment as nutrients and OM bind to fine sediment particles. Deeper waters tend to harbour muddier and therefore more enriched sediments, which impacts their sediment condition. This is particularly true in the Peel-Harvey, which experiences naturally low levels of tidal flushing due to the estuary’s narrow connections to the microtidal marine environment, and also declining freshwater flows under a drying climate which are reducing the degree of riverine flushing and leading to increased stratification and retention (Hallett et al., 2018; Valesini et al., 2019a). The finding of muddier, enriched sediments in the deeper waters of the Harvey Estuary matches patterns observed during historical sediment surveys in 1978–89 (McComb et al., 1998). The intensively fertilized Harvey catchment, with its particularly high density of artificial drains and sandy sediments with low nutrient binding capacity, has delivered large quantities of inorganic nutrients to the estuary over many decades (McComb and Humphries, 1992). Also, significant freshwater flows from the upper Harvey River have been artificially diverted to the ocean since the 1930s, contributing to the Harvey Estuary experiencing far less flushing than the Peel Inlet, which receives flows from the Serpentine and much larger Murray rivers. As a result, fine sediments, nutrients and OM from the Harvey catchment have tended to accumulate in its basin to a greater degree, with evident impacts on sediment enrichment and condition. This outcome has potentially important implications for the future management of water resources and downstream impacts in the Harvey Estuary, particularly under a drying climate that will see further reductions in flushing river flows (Hallett et al., 2018). The poorest sediment condition was observed in navigation channels and other areas of high deposition, including upper parts of the Serpentine and Murray rivers The poorest sediment condition in the Peel-Harvey Estuary occurred at highly depositional sites characterised by both high enrichment and mud content. These included the upper Serpentine and Murray rivers, the southeast corner of the Peel Inlet and the artificially deepened Yunderup Channel (Figs 8, 9). Flushing is minimal in the latter locations and thick macroalgal mats are known to accumulate and rapidly become buried below layers of fine sediment (Morgan et al., 2012). Previously, intensive studies of these channel sites have revealed strongly reducing (i.e. anoxic), monosulfidic sediments that can release ammonium and phosphates into the water column (Kraal et al., 2013b). These findings have significant implications given the forecast expansion of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey in coming decades, and particularly the proposed dredging of a new, large channel to support a major marina development at Point Grey, opposite the Dawesville Channel. The RAP could be employed for spatially extensive, yet rapid and cost-effective surveys of navigation channels and other highly depositional areas throughout the estuary, to quantify the extent of these highly degraded sediments and help better inform future dredging activities. 4.6.2 Identifying zones of chronic vs acute nutrient enrichment via sediment isotopes Stable isotopes highlighted hotspots of nitrogen enrichment We measured the isotope composition of the organic matter in the sediments (δ15N and δ13C) to get a better understanding of the sources and processes driving the observed sediment quality patterns. Based on the knowledge that sediment δ15N values will increase (become more positive) when there are higher rates of biological nitrogen removal relative to production, we identified two distinct ‘nitrogen removal zones’ (Fig. 10a). These were near the Mandurah Channel and along the western shore of the Harvey Estuary, and correspond to zones of particularly low TN concentrations (Fig. 9). The sediment nitrogen data thus confirms that the most eutrophied sediment region, which also corresponds to a region of high macrophyte abundance (see Valesini et al., 2019b), is still accumulating nitrogen. In contrast, the suspected excess nitrogen inputs from storm drains around Mandurah and septic leaks along the Harvey Estuary shore seem to be driving nitrogen removal from the sediments (hence low concentrations and high δ15N signatures in these locations). Sediment d13C data also brings a new dimension to the sediment quality distribution established above, by revealing that the high C content of the estuary sediments comes from decomposition of the abundant macrophyte beds (Valesini et al., 2019b), rather than export and accumulation of terrestrial C (Fig. 10b). Together these findings add some nuance to the sediment quality index, by demonstrating that, 1) some ‘healthy’ sediment zones may still be affected by human pollutants, and, 2) internal organic matter production is driving the observed declining sediment quality. Figure 4.11: (a) Map of sediment nitrogen stable isotope values (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) interpolated throughout the estuary. These values were measured on the total nitrogen (TN) and organic carbon (OC) pools, as reported in Fig. 9. Circles denote sediment sampling sites. 4.7 Conclusions Sediments in the Peel-Harvey are enriched with nutrients and organic matter Despite the intended aim of the Dawesville Channel to reduce nutrients in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, sediments throughout large parts of the system remain enriched with carbon and nitrogen, particularly in the deeper, muddier waters of the Harvey Estuary. Stable isotopes highlighted likely point sources of acute nitrogen pollution around the estuary, including along the western edge of Harvey Estuary and along the Murray River. Using this type of isotope approach to evaluate estuary sediment quality is relatively new (an adaption of soil quality assessment techniques). We plan further work to calibrate its sensitivity to human disturbances by measuring changes in sediment δ15N before, during and after dredging in the estuary. Enrichment negatively impacts the condition of sediments in the Peel-Harvey. Degraded sediment condition is likely to impact on the organisms inhabiting the sediment, the water quality in the estuary, and key ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling. Sediments in the poorest condition (monosulfidic black oozes) occur in areas of the estuary with high rates of deposition, including the Yunderup Channel and upper estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers. Further investigations of navigation channels and other depositional areas throughout the estuary, employing the RAP described here, are recommended to quantify the extent and consequences of these highly degraded sediments. The RAP provides a rapid and cost-effective tool for current and future monitoring of sediment condition The RAP is a robust measure of the degree of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition. RAP scores correctly identified the enrichment class of 84% of survey sites. The RAP is particularly good at identifying sites with low enrichment, highlighting its potential as a first-pass survey approach for identifying ‘least impacted’ reference sites to support future impact assessments in the Peel-Harvey Estuary. The outputs from the RAP assessment and accompanying quantitative analyses are being used to quantify sediment stressors throughout the system, which in turn provides a framework to assess the ecological responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and subsequently establish a biotic index of estuarine condition (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019). The RAP has broad applicability for supporting cost-effective monitoring of sediment condition, given its simple scoring system based on well-documented responses of sediment condition to enrichment, and accompanying ‘decision tree’ for classifying the condition of any new site. In particular, we recommend the RAP be employed for spatially extensive surveys of navigation channels and other highly depositional areas throughout the estuary, to quantify the extent of these highly degraded sediments and better inform future dredging activities. A broad program for future monitoring of sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey is proposed in Table 2 and Fig. 11. This program is purposely broad, the finer details for implementing the program needing to be determined depending on the level of interest in uptake and resourcing. Figure 4.12: Map of suggested sites for future monitoring of sediment condition throughout the estuary, based on the outcomes of the current study. Colours indicate sediment condition class, as assessed in the 2016 survey (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor). Red ellipses denote ‘watch’ areas, i.e. those deemed at greatest risk of impacted sediment condition, and which are particularly likely to require ongoing monitoring and management. Note that the location of all sites is provisional, and should be tailored for purpose prior to finalising any monitoring regime. 4.8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to Marta Sánchez-Alarcón, Helen Nice, Frances D’Souza and particularly Alan Cottingham for assistance with fieldwork; Graham Lancaster, Iain Alexander, Natasha Carlson-Perret and colleagues at the Environmental Analysis Laboratory and the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry Research, Southern Cross University, for laboratory processing of sediment samples, and Malcolm Robb for helpful discussions and advice.

We achieved this by first assessing the dominant forms of nitrogen and phosphorus found in the catchment sources (e.g. groundwater, rainwater, wastewater effluent and soil water) and in the receiving waters (e.g. drains, farm dams, rivers and the estuary basins). We then developed isotope-based indicators for the biological transformations that could limit the downstream flow of excess nitrogen. This approach revealed that (1) both groundwater and rainwater could bring excess reactive nitrogen to the estuary; (2) shallow receiving waters like drains and creeks play a critical role in removing excess nitrogen before it reaches the estuary, and; (3) up to 100% of inorganic nitrogen sources to the catchment are biologically-removed during downstream transport. Together, these findings lay the foundation for improved catchment-estuary nutrient modelling, as well as some directions around drain management that could help maximise nutrient removal, rather than simply water removal. 5.2 Background There is a long history of concern about excess nutrients leading to the over-enrichment of organic matter (eutrophication) in the Peel Harvey Estuary (Bradby et al., 1997; McComb et al., 1981). However, relatively little is known about how the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) that cause this over-enrichment to reach the estuary. Understanding how, why, where, and when nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) move from sources like agricultural soils and wastewater treatment plants to the estuary, is a critical (but complex) step in being able to effectively manage eutrophication in this system. This complexity stems, from the fact that microbes and vegetation can remove up to 100%, or as little as 0%, of excess nitrogen as it’s transported downstream from the catchment and/or atmospheric sources. This component of the ARC Linkage Project aims to improve knowledge of nutrient transport and transformations across the Peel Harvey system by measuring changes in the isotopic composition of different N and P forms. This approach is based on the knowledge that both the different nutrient pollution sources and the biological processes that limit nutrient transport downstream will impart unique isotopic ‘fingerprints,’ or signatures. Characterising the fingerprints for the different sources and processes could enable us to measure how efficiently nutrients moved through different portions of the catchment to the estuary. This type of isotope tracing approach has been successfully used in other temperate waterways to determine the extent of their eutrophication (Gooddy et al., 2016) or the particular nitrogen sources most responsible for driving this eutrophication (Xue et al., 2012). Detailed information on the origin, form and fate of nutrients across the Peel-Harvey catchment generated through this component of the ARC Linkage Project is designed to fill gaps in the catchment nutrient export model (presented in the complementary ARC Linkage report Kilminster et al. [2019]), and set the scene for future targeted work to improve ecosystem health in the identified ‘at risk’ zones (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019; Hallett et al., 2019). 5.3 Objectives Identify the dominant sources and forms of nutrients moving through the Peel-Harvey catchment and estuary. Assess the potential of isotopic tools to distinguish the identified nutrient sources. Identify the catchment locations and events that enhance nitrogen removal (biogeochemical ‘hot spots’ and ‘hot moments’). Evaluate the added value of incorporating isotope measurements into catchment nitrogen export models. 5.4 Approach 5.4.1 Conceptual model: Isotope fate and transport The conceptual model underpinning our work is based on the knowledge that different nitrogen (and maybe phosphorus) sources have unique concentrations of heavy vs light isotopes, and that biological removal of nitrogen (by processes including denitrification and assimilation into organic biomass) will preferentially remove only light isotopes (Fig. 1). This model informed our study design: we set out to evaluate the concentrations and isotopic composition of different nutrient sources across the Peel-Harvey catchment, and then track those sources as they moved through the complex network of drains, aquifers, farm dams, lakes and finally the estuary. Figure 5.1: Different nutrient sources (e.g. livestock waste, wastewater treatments, rain) have different quantities of heavy vs light isotopes. These sources will mix in surface waters, where biological removal will again alter the ratio of heavy to light isotopes by preferentially removing the latter. 5.4.2 Sample collection We collected samples from both receiving waters (defined as surface waters in the catchment and estuary) and N and P sources (defined as soils, fertilisers, and the non-surface waters that could directly flow to the surface water; Table 1). This sampling design enabled us to build a biogeochemical understanding onto the known hydrologic flow paths linking ‘sources’ and ‘receiving waters’ and avoid extraneous or duplicate sampling. For instance, we sampled soil water (which could directly leach into creeks, drains and rivers), but not the nitrogen fertilisers and livestock excreta that are applied to these soils (Table 1). The location of all sampling points is shown in Fig. 2, with most being sampled in both summer (February–March 2017) and winter (July–August 2017; see Table 1 for exceptions). In addition to the above sampling of sources and receiving waters, high-resolution temporal sampling (24 h continuous measurements) of different forms of nitrogen were carried out at two estuary locations (Fig. 2) in winter 2017 to assess how tides impacted their distributions. Figure 5.2: Examples of the different types of water bodies sampled across the Peel-Harvey system. The different flow dynamics and biological structure of these water bodies could have a major impact on how efficiently they remove excess nutrients. Figure 5.3: A map of the Peel-Harvey catchment and estuary showing locations where isotope samples were collected. The farms where the soil and feeder drain samples are outlined in grey, and the drain (yellow circle) where the WWTP samples were collected is indicated. 5.4.3 Isotope analyses In each of the samples collected from the various sources and receiving waters (Table 1), we first measured the concentration of the different species of P (dissolved organic P, and inorganic P, PO43-) and N (dissolved organic and inorganic N, as nitrate, NO3-, and ammonium, NH4+). We then analysed the isotope composition of the inorganic species. For P, this involved sending samples to our colleagues at the British Geological Survey for processing, as described in Davies et al. (2014). Phosphate isotope (δ18O-PO43-) samples were limited to the main sources (fertilisers and soils) due to the large sample volume required for these analyses, the very time-intensive preparation steps, and the need for significant method development before these analyses can be readily applied to samples with complex organic matrices and high salinities, as found throughout most of the Peel-Harvey system. Measuring the isotopic composition of N involved converting the two inorganic forms (NO3- and NH4+) to nitrous oxide (N2O), which we could then use to quantify the relative abundance of heavy to light isotopes for both N (δ15N) and O (δ18O). These analyses were performed in the stable isotope laboratory at Southern Cross University’s Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry. For more details on these methods, see McIlvin and Casciotti (2011) and Zhang et al. (2007). Figure 5.4: Analysing inorganic N isotope samples at the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry’s stable isotope lab (Lismore, NSW). 5.4.3.1 ‘What’: Characterize the sources and forms of catchment nutrients(Objectives 1 and 2) 5.4.3.1.1 Sources The main sources of P to the Peel-Harvey Estuary include fertilisers (rock phosphorus) leached through agricultural soils. The key sources of N include leaching from agricultural soils (which includes inputs from nitrogen fixing crops like clover and grazing livestock), effluent from wastewater treatment plants, inflows of historically contaminated groundwater, urban storm drains and rain water carrying reactive nitrogen mobilised from more distant (10–1,000 km) farms and industrial sources. We also evaluated the potential of precipitation to transport reactive nitrogen around the catchment. This is because ‘atmospheric transport’ can move nitrogen around agricultural catchments and confound traditional methods of identifying sources and sinks. The potential for rain to carry nitrogen has never been evaluated in Western Australia, so the importance of this nitrogen source to the Peel-Harvey system was unknown. Using the laboratory methods outlined above, samples of all of these sources were evaluated for the consistency of their isotope values, and thereby their usefulness for ‘fingerprinting’ these sources as they move through the catchment and estuary. 5.4.3.1.2 Forms Standard water quality models only consider nutrients as a ‘total’ of their forms (e.g. TN and TP). While this approach is efficient given the many chemical forms of both N and P that exist in the environment, it makes it difficult to accurately track changes in nutrient export. This is because, (1) the process used to measure TN and TP concentrations (persulfate oxidation of unfiltered samples) is imprecise and thus often obscures real changes occurring in the environment, and (2) the TN pool in particular is large and thus a fairly insensitive indicator of changes in nutrient pollution over space and time (Table 2). Figure 5.5: The sampling set-up used to measure gas concentrations across the Peel Harvey system. We also know that certain forms included in the TN pool, like nitrate (NO3-), exist in relatively low concentrations but can rapidly increase in response to human activities like N fertiliser use (Parfitt et al., 2012). This makes such inorganic forms (NO3- and NH4+) potentially more indicative of changes in pollution over space and time. The rest of the dissolved N pool is made up of organic molecules (DON), which can range from easily altered compounds like urea to large and non-biodegradable compounds (Sipler and Bronk, 2015). Therefore, the first objective that must be fulfilled in order to understand how nitrogen moves from land to the Peel-Harvey is to quantify the relative abundance and distribution of more labile nitrogen forms like NO3-, ammonium (NH4+), and DON. 5.4.3.2 ‘Where and When’: Identify nitrogen removal ‘hot spots’ and ’hot moments (Objective 3) 5.4.3.2.1 Spatial variations in nitrogen removal To determine which regions of the catchment were more biologically active (and thus more likely to remove source nutrients), we measured N concentrations and isotopes across a range of receiving waters from small feeder drains on farms (shallow, seasonally flowing, vegetated) to large regional drains (permanently flowing, high velocity, channelized) to the Peel and Harvey estuaries (shallow with a large surface area; Table 1, Fig. 2). At these sites, we also used laser instruments to measure dissolved concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gasses. Gas measurements are useful as they provide an independent indicator of biological productivity, and thus potential nutrient removal ‘hot spots.’ This is because CO2, CH4, and N2O are produced by the same microorganisms that consume excess nitrogen. 5.4.3.2.2 Temporal variations in nitrogen removal We carried out the same isotope and dissolved gas measurements over both winter (high flow) and summer (low flow) seasons. As there was an anomalously large rainfall event in the Murray catchment during this summer, we sampled both before and after this ‘flood.’ Unless otherwise noted the presented data is from the pre-flood (low flow) period. We further assessed the effect of extreme events on nutrient fluxes by sampling during a winter storm (wind speeds &gt;100 km h-1) very strong winds) in the Harvey Estuary. Seasonal variations in N forms, sources and removal were also assessed by measuring concentrations and isotopes in monthly samples from eight estuary sites that were collected for us by the Department of Environmental Regulation. 5.4.3.3 ‘Why’: Quantify implications for nitrogen export budgets (Objective 4) Current nutrient monitoring in the Peel-Harvey system (and thus the models based on this data) do not measure biological removal (‘attenuation’) processes that could occur as N is moved from catchment soils and/or rainfall sources to the waterways. A key aim of our isotope data was therefore to generate independent attenuation calculations that could be used to validate and improve the coupled catchment-estuary model being developed in other components of the current Linkage Project (Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019; Kilminster et al., 2019). Isotope-based calculations provide a measure of N removal that integrates N removal during transport to the sampled system and N removal within the sampled system. This approach will provide unique insight into the complex and poorly understood processes that occur as N is transported from land to water. 5.5 Main Findings 5.5.1 ‘What’: The majority of nitrogen in the Peel-Harvey is in organic forms Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON, that is, organic nitrogen smaller than 0.45 µm, see Table 2) dominated the nitrogen pool in all of the sampled surface waters, from farm dams to feeder drains to main drains to rivers to the estuary basins (Fig. 3). The fact that DON concentrations decreased as the size of the waterbody increased suggests that this comes from terrestrial sources that are gradually diluted downstream (Raymond et al., 2016). This is very different to the eutrophied catchments in temperate latitudes where the vast majority of research is conducted. Nitrate (NO3-) was also a significant portion of the nitrogen pool in a few of the main drains and in the Harvey and Murray rivers. Figure 5.6: Concentrations of N as DON, NO3- and NH4+ across the hydrologic gradient, from farm dams (‘pond’) to feeder drains, main drains, rivers then the estuary basins, measured in winter 2017. Reporting of nitrogen export from the Peel-Harvey catchment via catchment models primarily focus on total nitrogen (TN, that is, one composite measure of all organic, inorganic, and particulate forms, see Table 2) (Kilminster et al., 2019). This approach is analytically and computationally expedient, but potentially misses key information about ecosystem health. This is because biological organisms use the different nitrogen forms differently (e.g. because NH4+ is more likely to be used than NO3- it may be a stronger driver of eutrophication). The dominance of DON in a highly human-impacted system like the Peel-Harvey contrasts with water quality conditions in comparable systems in temperate regions, where NO3- tends to be the dominant nitrogen form. As a consequence, very little is known about how organisms use DON. More research will clearly be needed on this topic in order to fully understand the downstream impact of this type of nitrogen pollution in the Peel-Harvey system. 5.5.2 ‘What’: Nutrients originating from soils and groundwaters will be difficult to track, but rain provides a distinct inorganic nitrogen source 5.5.2.1 Fertilisers We sent our phosphate fertiliser samples to our collaborator Daren Gooddy at the British Geological Survey for analysis. Unfortunately, we found that the isotope composition of the phosphate fertilisers used in the Peel-Harvey region vary depending on both the fertiliser manufacturer and the year of production (Fig. 4). This means that the source signature of phosphorus isotopes would be too variable to make useful ‘fingerprints’ of agricultural run-off. Figure 5.7: The isotopic composition of PO43- in fertilisers sold to farmers in the Peel-Harvey catchment between 2012 and 2018. Dashed lines show mean values for AGRAS (top) and Superphosphate (bottom). 5.5.2.2 Soils We measured the isotope composition of the different forms of nitrogen found in soils (total nitrogen, TN, ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-) on six livestock farms across the Harvey (Farms B, A, F), Murray (Farms D and E), and Serpentine (Farm C) catchments (Fig. 5, and see Fig. 2 for farm locations). Figure 5.8: Box and whisker plots of the (a) isotope composition of the total soil N pool, (b) 2M KCl extractable NH4+, and (c, d) NO3- pools. Black diamonds indicate outlier values and boxes represent quartiles 1 – 3 around the median (black horizontal line). Note that Farm C has a significantly depleted δ15N-TN composition (a), while Farms A and D have significantly depleted δ15N and δ18O compositions of the extractable inorganic N forms (b, c, d). We found two distinct fingerprints in NO3- isotopes: farms with relatively high δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- values (B, C, E), and farms with relatively low δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- values (A, D; Fig. 5c, d). These differences must be driven by fundamental differences in soil biology between the farms, but were not easily explained by factors like soil type, soil moisture content, or current land-use. This was surprising because the farm sites were selected to span a range of soil leaching potential (i.e. sand to clay soils), and we expected to find less processed (i.e. lower) δ15N values in the sandier soils. Instead, we may potentially be detecting the influence of two other factors. First, a land-use legacy effect on soil nitrogen cycling being reflected in the nitrogen isotopes, creating distinct values between the different farms independent of soil type. For instance, many farms in the region have shifted from dairy (higher stocking rates) to beef (lower stocking rates) over the past few decades. Second, heavy rainfalls during the winter period ensured that even the well-drained soils were saturated, and thus could have hosted the types of microbial reactions that would enrich δ15N values (Table 2). Despite this complexity, the relatively small range of δ15N values in the total nitrogen pool (1.5 – 4.5 ‰, Fig. 5a) provide a reasonable ‘source’ fingerprint for our subsequent work assessing transformation during transport downstream to the estuary. 5.5.2.3 Groundwater At the upstream end of the hydrologic gradient, groundwater in the Peel-Harvey catchment can also contain very high levels of nitrogen (Fig. 6). However, N concentrations (and isotopes) were extremely variable between the different wells, ranging from ~0 µM to ~1,000 µM. A more in-depth study of the groundwater hydrology of the region would be needed to determine why high nitrogen concentrations persist in some locations but not others. The isotope composition of NO3- in the groundwater ranged from values that are typical for N leached from soil (‘terrestrial’) to values that reflect a clear human input to the groundwater (‘fertiliser’) (Fig. 6b). Despite this variability, our data demonstrate that groundwater can contain high concentrations of all three nitrogen forms, and thus could be a source of N enrichment to the estuary and other surface waters. Figure 5.9: (a) Variations in the concentrations of the dominant N forms and (b) isotopic composition of NO3-, when present, in groundwater in ten shallow wells (~4 m to water table). Wells were sampled both in the winter (Jul. 2017) and summer (Feb. 2017), but water chemistry did not differ significantly between these sampling dates. 5.5.2.4 Precipitation We were surprised to find such high and variable concentrations of all three nitrogen forms in rain falling in the Peel-Harvey catchment (Fig. 7). These high concentrations are likely caused by a combination of local reactive N off-gassed from soils, combustion, and bush fires and complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere (Jickells et al., 2016). Figure 5.10: (a) The concentration of different N forms in precipitation and (b) the isotopic composition of NO3- in precipitation that fell in the Peel-Harvey catchment in summer and winter 2017. To give these results context, the grey boxes in (b) show the commonly reported range of NO3- isotopes in NH4NO3 fertilisers and terrestrial soils. While rain NO3- isotope values did vary (e.g. between morning and afternoon showers), the very high values of oxygen isotopes (δ18O) in NO3- from rainwater mean that they provide distinct fingerprints of where and when ‘atmospheric’ nitrogen enters the large surface water bodies of the Peel-Harvey system. 5.5.3 ‘Where’: Shallow, productive waters are nitrogen removal hot-spots In order for N to be ‘removed’ (either converted into gaseous forms or taken up by plants) from the Peel-Harvey microbes will first need to convert the dominant DON into NH4+ (for plant uptake) or NO3- (the first step towards producing N2O and N2 gasses). The knowledge that the zones of greater biological activity will enhance the nitrogen ‘turnover’ reactions thus motivated us to start identifying nitrogen removal hot-spots by looking for areas with the highest concentrations of biologically-produced dissolved gasses. By far the highest concentrations of dissolved gasses in the drains (including drains and farm dams) around the catchment (Fig. 8). This suggests that the drains are very biologically active, and thus could play a critical role in controlling how much nitrogen reaches the estuary Figure 5.11: A summary of the dissolved gasses produced in different portions of the Peel Harvey catchment, from the main drains (0.9 % of the surface water by area) through the rivers (11% of the surface water by area) to the main estuary basins (87% of the surface water by area). The emissions of three gasses (N2O, CH4, and CO2) were all normalised to their ‘global warming potential’ (GWP), which is reported in Tg C y-1 and based on the assumption that CH4 has 28× the warming potential of CO2 and N2O has 280× the warming potential of CO2 (IPCC, 2013). Summer measurements of nitrogen concentrations and isotopes in the main drains supported this suggestion. The dramatic changes in δ15N signatures over the length of the drains (in the downstream direction) means that biological processes are working to recycle (or potentially remove) the nitrogen loads they’re receiving. Nutrient recycling occurs when nitrogen is converted between multiple forms, including incorporated into the biomass and then re-mineralised into the water column, without leaving the system. Nitrogen removal processes can be distinguished from recycling processes based on, (1) a consistent increase in isotope values as the concentrations decrease, and, (2) parallel increases in the N and O isotopes of NO3-. Here active N recycling and removal was most clearly demonstrated in the Waroona Drain downstream from the Waroona wastewater treatment plant, where NH4+ inputs were rapidly removed (Fig. 9, bottom panel) and converted to NO3- within a few kilometres of entering the drain (Fig. 9, middle panel). More intensive sampling through the middle reaches of the drain should be undertaken to identify the exact rate of conversion to NO3-, as currently this estimate is based on the one site we could access further downstream (Fig. 9). Despite this acknowledged uncertainty, the mirrored patterns of the δ15N composition and composition between the two inorganic N forms (NO3- and NH4+) are highly indicative of biological reactions. Thus, the inclusion of isotope data here enabled us to help rule out alternative explanations for the observed shift in concentrations downstream (e.g. inflowing groundwater). Figure 5.12: Changes in NO3- (centre, left axis, blue circles) and NH4+ (bottom, left axis, blue circles) in the Waroona Drain as water leaves the wastewater treatment plant (~26 km from the estuary) and approaches the Harvey Estuary. Data is from the summer sampling campaign. Note the very high NH4+ concentrations and low δ15N values (right axis, black crosses) closest to the plant. The isotope ‘source’ signature is almost immediately lost, and over 4 km in the drain, all of the NH4+ has converted to NO3- via microbial reactions. At the opposite end of the hydrologic gradient, we also found evidence that the shallow waters in the estuary basins rapidly consumed all of the inorganic nitrogen exported through the rivers (Fig. 10a). Although NO3- concentrations were high in the rivers due to terrestrial (soil and groundwater) sources, these concentrations dropped to ~0 ug N l-1 near the Dawesville Cut and Mandurah Channel. Examination of the isotope composition of the NO3- that did persist in these portions of the estuary showed that this nitrogen originated from rain, not from the rivers (Fig. 10b). This change in nitrogen source between particularly the Murray River and the western side of Peel Inlet highlights how efficiently the shallow estuary waters consumed and recycled inorganic nitrogen. This general pattern persisted both during and after the high-flow summer ‘flood’ event we sampled. However, inputs of terrestrial nitrogen are likely helping to fuel the high sediment N concentrations (Hallett et al., 2019) and large and persistent green macroalgal communities found in the estuary, particularly the south east corner (Valesini et al., 2019). Figure 5.13: (a) Concentrations of NO3-, the most mobile nitrogen form, across the estuary and main rivers, measured in March 2017. Warmer colours indicate higher concentrations, and black circles indicate locations where samples were collected. (b) The isotope composition of this NO3- shows that the higher loads carried in the rivers primarily came from soil / terrestrial sources (see Fig. 5), while closer to the ocean, the small amounts of NO3- present came primarily from rain /atmospheric deposition (see Fig. 7). 5.5.4 ‘When’: Both the source and amount of nitrogen reaching the estuary fluctuates seasonally 5.5.4.1 Sources Winter rainfalls produce a distinct ‘drainage season’ in the Peel-Harvey, which also seems to change the sources of new nutrients moving through the system. Additionally, the importance of key nutrient sources varies depending on location in the estuary. This is clearly illustrated by the differences in groundwater inputs (as reflected by measurements of a qualitative tracer, radon, 222Rn, see Wells et al. [2018] for more information) measured between seasons in the Murray and Serpentine rivers and lower Harvey Estuary (Fig. 11). First, the persistently higher concentrations in the Murray suggest that groundwater contributes more to the river flow, and thus likely nutrient levels, in that system. This is an important finding given the high nitrogen concentrations we found in much of the shallow groundwater in the region. The seasonal fluctuations then further suggest that low summer water flows maximise groundwater inputs to the Murray River, but almost completely cut off the lower Serpentine and Harvey Estuary from the groundwater. The potentially very high nitrogen concentrations in this groundwater (section 5.2.3) means that this seasonal switch could have a major impact on how much nitrogen reaches the estuary. Figure 5.14: Concentrations of 222Rn, a qualitative indicator of groundwater inputs, detected in the surface water in the tidal portions of the Murray and Serpentine Rivers, as well as the Harvey Estuary, in the dry summer period (February 2017) and the wet winter period (July 2017). Higher values indicate a higher relative contribution of groundwater to the surface water body. 5.5.4.2 Processes We also found major seasonal differences the nitrogen isotopes measured in the receiving waters. As demonstrated in section 5.5, the δ15N-NO3- and δ15N-NH4+ values were generally less variable in the winter than the summer. This most likely reflects the fact that colder temperatures and faster flows in the winter limit the biological processes responsible for nitrogen isotope variations. 5.5.5 ‘Why’: Both natural streams and artificial drains remove significant quantities of nitrogen during transport towards the estuary Catchment models currently predict daily TN exported via major rivers and drains into the estuary (Fig. 12), where the flux of N from the catchment to the estuary (Nexport) is approximated as a function of downstream discharge (Q) and the TN concentration measured at the gauging station, i.e. \\[ N_{export} = Q*N \\] Where Q is in ML d-1 and N is in mg N l-1. Biological nitrogen removal is termed ‘attenuation’ to specify removal via microbial conversion to inert gasses, e.g., denitrification converting reactive NO3- to inert N2 gas, see Table 2. Evidence that these critical attenuation processes occur non-linearly over space and time means that assuming a direct relationship between N concentrations, flows and catchment nitrogen losses can dramatically underestimate actual N losses from the system (Bernhardt et al., 2017). Including terms for N attenuation therefore produces more sensitive catchment nutrient export models, where changes to N inputs in the system are not masked by changes in biological N removal. We used NO3- isotope samples collected regularly over distance in the Punrak Drain, Peel Main Drain, and upper Serpentine River (Fig. 2) to constrain the proportion of N attenuation occurring as N is transported to and through these systems. Two models were used to calculate attenuation, with the final attenuation coefficient being the range between the two generated values. Based on the findings for Objective 1 (section 3), the first model defined the NO3- ‘source fingerprint’ as nitrified soil N (calculated using theoretical mixing and fractionation ratios and measured δ15N-TN), while the second model defined the NO3- ‘source fingerprint’ as the mean soil δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- measured across the six sampled farms (Fig. 2). The difference between these ‘source fingerprints’ and the measured NO3- in the receiving waters was then used to calculate N removal (Fig. 13). This was based on the knowledge that any increase in isotope values relative to the sources must have been caused by biological removal (Hogberg, 1997). Figure 5.15: (a) Estimated daily discharge and (b) N export through two drains (Punrak and Peel Main) and one stream (Upper Serpentine) that run parallel to each other along the northern end of the Peel-Harvey catchment. Estimates are based on gauged flow in each system and monthly measured TN concentrations at the gauging stations in 2017. Rectangles indicate dates for the summer and winter sampling campaigns for N forms and isotopes. Figure 5.16: Plots showing the relative isotopic enrichment of O (y axis) and N (x axis) in NO3- measured in the surface water of two drains (Punrak and Peel Main) and the upper Serpentine River feeding the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Rectangles indicate the isotopic range of known N sources to the system, and the 1:1 line indicates the pattern produced during biological N attenuation. Note differences in the scales between summer and winter plots. Based on this knowledge that biological N removal predictably increases the values of δ15N and δ18O in the residual NO3- pool as the reaction progresses, we calculated net attenuation based on the difference between the δ15N and δ18O values measured within each system and the calculated ‘initial’ concentrations for that NO3- pool, i.e. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Attenuation} &amp;= 1-e^{(\\delta-\\delta_{0})/\\epsilon} \\\\ Atten_{total} &amp;= \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{d[\\text{Attenuation}]}{dx} \\ \\end{align*} \\] Where δ is the measured δ15N-NO3- or δ18O-NO3- value at a given location, δ0 is the established ‘source’ value for that isotope (using either model 1 or model 2), and ε is the known degree of isotopic enrichment caused by N removal. The top equation generates the proportion of the initial N pool attenuated, which is then calculated for each location along the stream and integrated over stream length (x) to generate the proportion of the total N load attenuated (Attentotal). For more details on this equation and approach, see (Wells et al., 2019; Wells et al., 2016). The generated Attentotal value was then folded into the established catchment Nexport model (Huang et al., 2019; Kilminster et al., 2019) to better capture Nexport differences driven by biology vs hydrology, i.e. \\[ N_{total} = N_{export} + Atten_{total} N_{export} \\] Using this approach, we found that N attenuation was consistently lower in the Peel Main Drain than in either Punrak or Serpentine, and that attenuation in all three systems was lower in the winter than the summer (Fig. 14). This latter finding is to be expected given the lower temperatures and faster flows, and provides a ‘first-principles’ validation of the method. However, the situation in the Peel Main Drain is a bit more puzzling, in that N concentrations are consistently very high, but attenuation very low. This could be due to either the relatively fast flows in that drain, where vegetation etc are frequently removed, meaning that N-removing organisms don’t have enough time to take up the available N. Figure 5.17: Daily N exported to the Peel-Harvey via the upper Serpentine River (top), Punrak Drain (middle), and Peel Main Drain (bottom), calculated from logged stream flow and modelled TN concentrations (coloured lines and symbols) and accounting for biological attenuation during transport (black areas, which cover the range of calculated values). Grey background indicates winter months (high flow). Question marks on %Attenuation are due to lack of measurable NO3- in the surface water. This data set also reveals one of the major limitations to quantifying N removal: we can only measure removal when nitrate is present. So, in the summer Peel Main Drain, where nitrate concentrations are consistently too low to measure, we are unable to assess whether these low concentrations are due to high removal rates or low inputs. The fact that ‘nil’ reactive N concentrations are recorded can thus indicate either a healthy waterway (no excess nutrient inputs) or a highly reactive yet polluted waterway (excess nutrient inputs drive rapid nitrogen removal). This poses a significant challenge to water quality monitoring, which requires robust reactive-transport models to resolve (Hipsey et al., 2019). 5.6 Conclusions Our work to-date in the Peel-Harvey system has produced three critical take-home messages: The improved understanding of the source and form of nitrogen moving through the Peel-Harvey system will underpin on-going work to quantify human and climatic effects on water quality. Our findings that two rivers (Murray and Harvey) carried high loads of NO3-, which is indicative of human impacts exceeding the ecosystem’s capacity to absorb nutrients, suggests that remediation activities should target these two systems. At the same time, our work highlights the need to better understand how reactive the very large DON pool is, and whether this reactivity varies between catchment locations. Are human activities increasing its concentration or altering its chemistry? Such changes would have knock-on effects to the nitrogen recycling and removal dynamics we uncovered here. There is a need for greater research and management efforts to target the drains and farm dams across the Peel-Harvey system, given the evidence for the potentially high biological productivity and N attenuation occurring in these often-overlooked features Future work should focus on identifying the characteristics of these small waterways that maximise the N attenuation capacity that we have demonstrated they could achieve, to help reduce nutrient inflows into the estuary. For instance, it is clear from our study that Punrak Drain removes more N than Peel Main Drain or the Serpentine River, but the precise features of the drain that drive this are not clear. Further investigation into the relationships between N attenuation and drain features such as morphology, groundwater inputs, flow rates, and vegetations is warranted to help mitigate nutrient pollution of the receiving waters. Accurately assessing nutrient pollution and impacts in a eutrophied system like the Peel-Harvey requires a nuanced approach The detailed assessments of nitrogen turnover in the shallow drains and estuary also highlight a major limitation to our current ability to track this pollutant. Namely, how can we distinguish zones where inorganic nitrogen concentrations are zero due to eutrophication (e.g. overgrowth of macrophytes in the Peel Estuary) vs zones where inorganic nitrogen concentrations are zero due to a lack of pollution? We need to develop multi-proxy systems for determining the extent of nitrogen pollution that are able to identify both zones like the Peel Estuary, which both receives and retains high inorganic nitrogen loads (low concentrations in the water), and the Murray River, which receives and exports high inorganic nitrogen loads (high concentrations in the water). 5.7 Acknowledgements Thanks to Natasha Carlson-Perret, Iain Alexander, Matheus Carvahlo de Carvahlo, and Hanieh Tohidi Farid for assistance processing samples in the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry laboratories.

The most significant period was between 2006 and 2011 with the region’s employment growth rate reaching 28.7%. It was then followed by an employment growth rate of 18.8 between 2011 and 2016. Over the same decade, the total Western Australian workforce increased from 936,130 people to 1,157,735 people. The proportion of Peel-Harvey’s workforce to that of Western Australia during the period increased by 1.1%, from approximately 4.5% to 5.6%. Competitive advantage In 2006, the highest employing industries in the Peel-Harvey Region by number of people and % of the total employment in the region were: Manufacturing (6244, 14.7%) Construction (5489, 13%) Retail trade (5211,12.3%) In 2011, these three industries were still the ones with highest employment level and employment growth rate, however, the order changed with construction taking the lead: Construction (7257, 13.3%) Manufacturing (7082, 13%) Retail trade (6116, 11.2%) In 2016, construction and retail trade remained in the top three industries with the highest employment level and employment growth, however, manufacturing dropped out and was replaced by health care and social assistance: Construction (7594, 11.8%), Retail trade (6976, 10.8%) Health care and social assistance (6817, 10.6%) Between 2006 and 2011, agriculture declined from 1630 to 1391 people employed, or from 3.8% to 2.6% of the total workforce in Peel-Harvey. Between 2011 and 2016 it rebounded slightly in terms of raw numbers, but due to overall increase in Peel-Harvey’s workforce, this amounted to only 2.5% of the total employment in the region. Comparative advantage Over the full period between 2006 and 2016, the Peel Harvey region’s economy remained specialised in the following industries: manufacturing, construction, agriculture, retail trade and electricity, gas, water and waste services. In 2011, the region became specialised in mining. By 2016, mining surpassed agriculture in the degree of specialisation for the region. The majority of all other industries in Peel-Harvey also grew in size between 2006 and 2016. However, there are some exceptions to this trend, which include: information, media and telecommunications which declined in the period from 2006 to 2011, but grew in the period from 2011 to 2016; and wholesale trade, which declined in the period from 2011 to 2016. 6.2 Background This research component forms part of an Australian Research Council Linkage Project LP150100451 (the ‘ARC Linkage Project’) aimed at understanding the relational dynamics of the ecological and socio-economic system(s) of the Peel-Harvey estuary and surrounding catchment areas (the ‘Peel-Harvey Region’). Two major challenges are predicted for the Peel-Harvey Region within the next 30 years: (i) a major increase in population growth, and (ii) a significant further drying and warming of the regional climate (Valesini et al., 2019). The need to get the right balance between development aspirations and estuarine health has never been more important. This research component focuses on understanding local competitiveness in thePeel-Harvey Region’s economic system. This research uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and Housing time series profiles, which count the number of persons in each industry of employment (based on place of enumeration) for all 138 local government areas (LGAs) in Western Australia for the census periods 2006, 2011 and 2016. The three most recent census periods have been selected as the most relevant for the purposes of this research (and due to lack of concordance in data collection methods for census periods prior to 2006). Boundaries for the LGAs of the Peel-Harvey Region – Boddington, Harvey, Mandurah, Murray, Waroona and Serpentine-Jarrahdale - are according to the ABS 2016 definition. To identify the key and strategic industries for each LGA, employment is disaggregated by industrial sector, as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) industry coding (see Appendix 1). It should be noted that one limitation widely reported by local governments is the likely undercount of employees by the ABS. This arises out of the difficulty in capturing fly-in/fly-out workers and other temporary residents. In this research, place of usual residence data has been used. The scope of the study is based on the political boundaries of the LGAs that ‘overlap’ the Peel-Harvey Estuary and primary catchment areas (see map at Appendix 3). The estuary, which covers approximately 130 km2, lies predominantly in the smallest of the nine formal planning regions for the State of Western Australia, the Peel Region. However, some of the 9,400 km2 of the three main river subcatchments of the estuary extend into part of the South West Region. Accordingly, there are five LGAs in the Peel Region, and one in the South West region, whose boundaries broadly ‘overlap’ those of the estuarine ecological system to form the ‘Peel-Harvey Region’ for the purposes of this study: Shire of Boddington (Peel) Shire of Harvey (South West) City of Mandurah (Peel) Shire of Murray (Peel) Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale (Peel) Shire of Waroona (Peel) 6.3 Objectives The objective of this research component is to undertake an investigation of the Competitive Advantage and Comparative Advantage of the Peel-Harvey Region economy. This links with the broader research objectives: To construct a simple model with which to conduct scenario analysis on the impacts of ecological and/or socio-economic changes in the Peel-Harvey Region. To link the model of competitive and comparative advantage across the Peel-Harvey Region to an ecological land use model that is being developed through the ARC Linkage Project as a tool to inform planning &amp; development decisions. 6.4 Approach Understanding “Local Competitiveness” and “Comparative Advantage” Cities and regions compete with each other for global, national, and local ‘market share.’ The drivers that shape local economies encompass both the impacts of globalisation, technological, and environmental change and local geographical conditions. Furthermore, industries perform differently in particular locations and, not surprisingly, localities perform differently to each other. Some of those reasons include natural resources, geographic advantages, access to transport, energy or information networks, local policies and human capital. Human capital brings knowledge, skills and competencies which have a productive value. Housing, education, amenity and services all shape the availability and employability of human capital (Plummer and Taylor, 2001). The transition of the Western Australian economy from the mining investment boom to broader-based growth creates challenges to localities across the State, while bringing opportunities for growth and prosperity in others (Plummer et al., 2014). Policy and institutional settings will also impact local and regional capacity to respond to changes in economic, ecological and social conditions, and their dynamic interdependency. Building on the conceptual and empirical foundations of ‘New Regionalism,’ we refer to recent government publications including a 2014 report published by the former Western Australian Department of Regional Development identifying the key drivers of local competitive and comparative advantage across the Western Australian economy, and a more recent report published by the Australian Government Productivity Commission (2017), identifying challenges that particular regions face in successfully transitioning from mining to a more sustainable economic base. In response to the identified ecological and demographic challenges being faced by the locations included in the ARC Linkage Project, this research component sets out the structure, dynamics, and competitiveness of the Peel-Harvey Region economy. 6.4.1 Local Competitive Advantage: the ability to create jobs locally The competitive advantage of a locality can be imputed, or calculated, from information on both the number of persons employed in each industry (‘size’) and those industries that are growing most rapidly in terms of their ability to create jobs relative to a benchmark economy (’growth’). Using the benchmark of the overall performance of the Western Australian economy, it is possible to categorize local industries as: Fast growing: relatively large sectors that have exhibited rapid recent growth. Restructuring: relatively large sectors that make a significant contribution to the economic base but with little or no growth over the recent past. Underdeveloped: low levels of activity in terms of employment and the contribution to the local economy. 6.4.2 Comparative Advantage: local economic specialization and interregional-trade patterns Conventionally it is assumed that localities specialize in those activities in which they have a comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the principle that a country, region or locality should specialise in producing and exporting goods in which it has comparative or relative cost advantage over others, and import goods in which it has a cost disadvantage. The comparative advantage of the Peel-Harvey Region is imputed using information on the importance of an industry in terms of the degree to which the local economy specializes in that economic activity (‘specialisation’) and a measure of the degree to which economic activity and employment is related to servicing local demand as against servicing demand external to the region (’economic base’). Determining the pattern of local economic specialisation using location quotients identifies the industries that drive and underpin the local economy (see Appendix 1). Location quotients (LQ) measure the concentration of an industry or economic activity in a particular location, compared to a benchmark economy, in this instance Western Australia. Typically, this is measured as the proportion of people employed in an industry in a locality relative to the proportion of people employed in that industry in the benchmark economy. If a particular industry’s share of regional employment is greater than that industry’s share of State employment, i.e. the location quotient is greater than one, (or unity), then the locality is assumed to specialize in that economic activity. Since local economic data on trade flows does not exist, location quotients have also been widely used to infer regional trade patterns (see Appendix 2): Basic sector: The greater the location quotient above one (or unity), the larger the economy’s net sectoral exports from that sector (i.e. the greater the proportion or share of the local economy of a particular industry, and therefore exports from that region). Non-basic sector: The greater the location quotient below unity (or one), the larger the economy’s net sectoral imports from that sector (i.e. the proportion or share of the local economy of a particular industry is less than the overall State proportion, and therefore imports into that region). Neutral sector: For a location quotient of unity, (or one), the economy is neither a net exporter nor a net importer for that sector. 6.4.3 Classifying Industrial Activities Combining the information on an economy’s ability to create jobs locally (Competitive Advantage) and identifying the patterns of specialization and inter-regional trade within sectors of the economy (Comparative Advantage), it is possible to classify industries in terms of their impact on the growth potential of a locality. Fig. 1 classifies the economic structure of a local economy with relative growth measured on the vertical axis and relative specialization measured on the horizontal axis: Important growth industries: characterized by above average employment growth, relative economic specialization, and export orientation. Important industries that may require attention: characterized by below average employment growth, relative economic specialization, and export orientation. Potential emergent industries: characterized by above average employment growth, but currently oriented towards servicing local demand. Industries of little promise: characterized by below average employment growth and currently oriented towards servicing local demand. Figure 6.1: Classification of Industrial Structure. 6.5 Main Findings Figs 2(a) and 2(b) summarise the economic structure of the Peel-Harvey economy: The Peel-Harvey economy is relatively diverse with six specialised industries, however, growth in each of these sectors was not consistent between 2006 and 2016. (The size of the ‘bubbles’ in Figure 2 relates to the relative size of the industry in terms of the number of people employed). Agriculture is important, especially by comparison to the Western Australian economy but overall does not employ a large number of people in Peel-Harvey compared with other industries. The majority of other industry sectors, without further attention, will likely remain ’potential emergent industries’ from a local competition perspective. Although, promisingly, they all grew between 2006 and 2016. The exceptions to this trend, were: information, media and telecommunications which declined in the period from 2006 to 2011 to become an ‘industry of little promise’, but grew again in the period from 2011 to 2016, lifting its status to’potential emergent industry’; and wholesale trade, a ‘potential emergent industry’ in 2006 and 2011, but declined in the period from 2011 to 2016 and so classified as an’industry of little promise’. In the 2006–2011 period, the only sector that showed both poor relative growth and limited specialisation in Peel-Harvey was information, media and telecommunications which was therefore designated an ‘industry of little promise’. While manufacturing, construction, retail trade, real estate (Rental, Hiring and Real Estate Services) and utilities (Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services) were the’important growth industries’ (based on relative growth and specialisation compared with the broader Western Australian economy). Agriculture, due to a decline in the number of people employed and ongoing comparative specialisation was identified as an ’important industry that may require attention’. In the 2011-2016 period, agriculture rebounded somewhat to reclaim its status as an ‘important growth industry’, and was joined in this quadrant by mining which grew more significantly in terms of employee numbers as well as becoming a specialisation for the Peel-Harvey Region. However, manufacturing while remaining a specialisation for the region, declined in size to become an’important industry that may require attention’. Information, media and telecommunications grew very slightly thereby ceasing to be in the ‘industry of little promise’ and transitioning to a’potential emergent industry’. Wholesale trade decreased in employee numbers over the same period leading it to change its status from ‘potential emergent industry’ to’industry of little promise’. Figure 6.2: The relative growth of the industry based on level of local specialization for 2006-2011. Figure 6.3: The relative growth of the industry based on level of local specialization for 2011-2016. 6.6 Conclusions The contemporary Western Australian economy can be characterized by a multi-speed economy, driven by a strong and consistent pattern of job creation that has not played out evenly across Western Australia. This has resulted in an increasingly ‘patchwork economy,’ with larger and more economically diverse economies forging ahead of less resilient or smaller regions. Empirical analysis of both Comparative Advantage and Competitive Advantage provide valuable information on both existing and strengths and weaknesses of the Peel-Harvey region. More broadly, Competitive Advantage and Comparative Advantage are technically two separate concepts which measure different dimensions of economic performance. However, when viewed together they have the potential to provide information on: Multiple factors in the economy of a particular place; The relationship of a particular locality with other localities nearby; The interdependence between industries; and The performance of that economy compared to other local economies. This research component unpacks the growth experience of the Peel-Harvey Region. The dynamics and drivers of local competitiveness and comparative advantage shape a regional economy’s responsiveness to externalities and help explain the underlying forces triggering ‘catch-up,’ ‘falling behind’ and ‘forging ahead.’ They also assist in forecasting economic impacts including: The direct and indirect effect of investing in the region, The influence of local investment beyond the region, The potential for diffusion of external shocks across the economic system, and The potential significance of ecological change and/or environmental policy on the relative competitiveness of the local economy.

These models allow the nutrient export delivered to the estuary to be estimated and the major sources of these nutrients to be identified. This allows management actions to be targeted where they will have the most capacity to reduce nutrient export. The model indicates that the nutrient load from all sub-catchments reaching the estuary is approximately 630 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 60 tonnes per year of phosphorus, averaged from 2006–2015. Additional nutrient loads also flow out to the ocean or are stored in dams. The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen, beef cattle farms (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy cattle farms (6.8%) and, for phosphorus, beef cattle (67%), dairy cattle (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%). The catchment model, which was coupled with an estuary response model developed in other components of this ARC Linkage project, was then used to compare a range of scenarios proposed for 2050 by stakeholders across the Peel region. These scenarios encapsulated three different catchment management narratives (termed ‘environmentally optimistic, ’business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic/economically optimistic’) under two climate regimes (current climate and 2050 predicted climate). Full details of the catchment model development, calibration and outputs of the tested scenarios relating to (i) land-use change, (ii) nutrient management and (iii) climate are outlined in separate documents detailed in the following report. 7.2 Background This study used catchment-scale models to estimate the water flows and loads and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Peel-Harvey Estuary and the ocean. The Source (eWater®) modelling platform was used to develop hydrological and nutrient models, which require meteorological and land-cover input data, and are calibrated using the data from flow and water quality monitoring sites located throughout the Peel-Harvey catchment. This modelling is an update of the work done by Kelsey et al. (2011), using different models and methodology. The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) is currently preparing a detailed technical report on this revised catchment modelling, and exploring a suite of scenarios of land-use change, catchment management actions and climate change (Hennig et al., in prep.). Specific catchment model outputs were made available to inform a set of three 2050 narratives or ‘plausible futures’ proposed by Peel stakeholders during the ARC Linkage project. The scenarios underpinning these narratives, which are detailed in Hipsey et al. (2019a), comprised specific land-use, catchment management and climate combinations. The catchment model outputs for each of these scenarios were then coupled with the estuary hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models developed in other parts of the Linkage (see Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019b). This enabled forecasting of estuarine ecosystem response under each 2050 scenario (see Hipsey et al. 2019a). Beyond this project, the revised Peel-Harvey catchment model will also inform the development of the Peel-Harvey Estuary Protection Plan and a revision of the Peel Harvey Water Quality Improvement Plan, which are currently being developed by DWER. 7.3 Objectives Create a calibrated catchment hydrological model to estimate flow and nutrient loads in the Peel-Harvey. Run the model for a suite of 2050 scenarios related to catchment land-use, management and climate. Provide the above catchment output data (flow, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) to the coupled Peel-Harvey estuary model to support forecasting of estuarine response under each 2050 scenario. 7.4 Approach 7.4.1 Model description Constructing a model for a particular catchment management situation involves selecting appropriate component models and linking them in the software (including rainfall-runoff models, nutrient export and filtering models, streamflow routing models etc.). We used the Source (eWater®) modelling platform as it is becoming a national standard for catchment modelling and is at the core of the National Hydrological Modelling Platform program (Welsh et al., 2011). Source is based on the following building blocks: Catchments: The sub-catchment is the basic spatial unit, which is then divided into hydrological response units (or functional units) based on a common response or behaviour such as land-use. Nodes: Nodes represent sub-catchment outlets, stream confluences or other places of interest such as stream gauges or dam walls. Nodes are connected by links, forming a representation of the stream network. Links: Links represent the river reaches. Within each link, a selection of models can be applied to route or delay the movement of water along the link or modify the contaminant loads due to processes occurring within the links, such as the decay of a particular constituent over time. The basis of the hydrological model comprised three different models for land-uses classified as urban, cleared and vegetated, and their combined flow describes the total flow (Fig. 1). Each of the 23 descriptive land-use classes identified across the Peel-Harvey catchment (Fig. 2) were assigned to the broader urban, vegetated or cleared categories. The hydrological model was calibrated predominantly using gauged station data from 2000–2015. Urban: Urban land-uses (such as urban residential, commercial and education offices, industry, manufacturing and transport) were assigned the calibrated parameters for Bannister Creek, as this was the gauge with the best calibration metrics. Vegetated: Vegetated land-uses (such as plantations, rural living [bush block], native vegetation) were calibrated to vegetated gauged catchments. Model parameters were assigned by major river (Serpentine and Murray). Cleared: Cleared land-uses (such as dairy, beef, cropping, horticulture) were calibrated to flow gauging stations throughout the Peel-Harvey catchment. Figure 7.1: Components of the hydrological model at the modelling catchment scale. Cleared, urban and vegetated land-uses have unique hydrological models. The flow generated from these land-uses amount to the total flow generated by a modelling catchment, as indicated by the blue ‘total’ graph. The nutrient model framework in Source has four modules: Constituent generation models: which determine how constituents (e.g. sediments or nutrients) are generated within a functional unit (e.g. a land-use parcel within a sub-catchment) and the resulting concentrations or loads that are passed to the filter model. Inflow nodes: Inflow nodes have been used to include point sources of nutrients, septic tanks, dam inflows and irrigation returns. The nutrients from these sources are external to the constituent generation and filtering models. Filtering models: which represent any transformation of constituents between generation within the functional unit and arrival at the sub-catchment node. Filtering models process constituents within the functional units. Filtering models have been used to represent nutrient processes in vegetated riparian zones. In-stream processing models: This model has not been included explicitly in-stream processing models. Instead, these processes are implicit within the catchment calibration process. The diffuse nutrient model uses the power function (flow in mm) constituent generation model to generate total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations. The modelling functional units include the 23 land-use categories and two soil phosphorus retention index (PRI) categories (to represent poor soils that are prevalent on the Swan Coastal Plain). Calibration was undertaken for all catchments upstream of water quality monitoring sites and was used for both nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrient model was calibrated to winter nutrient concentration data for the period of 2011–2015. Dairy farms were modelled using the same approach described for the diffuse nutrient model. However, farm nutrient surplus was modified using a farm nutrient budget that considered nutrients from paddock and dairy shed effluent. Water and nutrients from dam releases and irrigation returns were calculated separately and included as inflow nodes. Riparian zone nutrient removal was calculated linearly with 0% removal for modelling catchments with 0% riparian zone vegetation and the maximum nutrient removal for catchments with 100% riparian zone vegetation. Stream order was also considered. It was assumed that first- and second-order streams required half the vegetated riparian zone width of larger-order streams to achieve the same percentage nutrient reductions (Hennig and Kelsey, 2015). The vegetated riparian zone nutrient-removal percentages were assumed to be the same as the ‘medium’ quality riparian zone efficacy given in the Leschenault Estuary Water Quality Improvement Plan (Hugues-dit-Ciles et al., 2012; see Error! Reference source not found. in that report). The nutrient removal of riparian zones on the Swan Coastal Plain was assumed to be less effective that those in inland areas (Hugues-dit-Ciles et al., 2012). 7.4.2 Model input data Meteorological data was derived from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) which provides daily gridded rainfall, temperature, vapour pressure and solar exposure data. Daily rainfall and calculated potential evapotranspiration (PET) data were extracted for the centroids of the modelling catchments for 1/1/1960 to 31/12/2015. PET was calculated using the FAO56 methodology (Allen et al., 1998; Ladson 2008), with missing data infilled as following: Solar exposure data was not available pre-1990. Global exposure data was substituted prior to 1990. Vapour pressure was not available prior to 1971 and was infilled using average monthly vapour pressure from 1971-2015. The catchment model climate data series was later updated with SILO data from 1/1/2016 to 8/10/2018 to generate data for the estuary model. At the time, AWAP data could not be generated. More information about SILO data can be found here. The land-use mapping dataset from Kelsey et al. (2011) was updated to represent land-use present in 2015, and was informed by the state cadastre dataset (Landgate), aerial photography, upper storey vegetation calculated from LIDAR (DWER) and native vegetation data (Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development) (Fig. 2). The land-use mapping update focused on the inclusion of new urban developments, large-scale changes to agricultural land-uses and practices, intensive agriculture and riparian zone revegetation. Nutrients associated with land-use (e.g. input, surplus rates and nutrient use efficiencies) were assigned with data sourced from relevant literature and assumptions. Nutrient surplus is equal to nutrient input minus nutrient output. Nutrient surpluses can be stored (e.g. in livestock, soil or plant matter) or lost from the land parcel. Nutrient losses can occur though leaching to groundwater, via surface runoff, or to the atmosphere (e.g. wind erosion, fire, denitrification, volatilisation). Nutrient use efficiency (NUE) is nutrient out divided by nutrient in, expressed as a percentage. Land-uses with 100% NUE convert all nutrient inputs to nutrient outputs and therefore have a nutrient surplus of zero. Fig. 3 shows land-uses ranked by nutrient surplus and nutrient use efficiency. Other input data included soil phosphorus retention, environmental water provision/releases, irrigation returns, point sources (e.g. feedlots, stockyards, piggeries, abattoirs, poultry, industrial and waste water treatment plant) and septic tanks (more than 12,000 in the Peel-Harvey Estuary catchments). Fig. 4 displays the full extent of the Peel-Harvey catchment, including its main drainage features and reporting catchment boundaries. 7.4.3 Model calibration Full details of model calibration, parameterisation and model performance will be provided in Hennig et al. (in prep.). Where possible, the hydrological models were calibrated for the 2000–2015 period and validated using data from 1980–1999. This was done so that the hydrological model produced accurate results for the period for which most results were derived (2006–2015) and because the 2000–2015 period had substantially lower flow. As a result, the model consistently underestimated larger flow events that were present in the validation period of 1980–1999. The nutrient models were calibrated using data recorded at water quality monitoring sites across the catchment. Five-year winter median nutrient concentrations (2011–2015) were used as the primary calibration statistic, with a difference of ±15% deemed acceptable and a difference of ±5% set as the calibration objective. All sites had modelled median winter nutrient concentrations within 5% of observed winter median concentrations (Fig. 5). Figure 7.2: Land-use classes for the Peel-Harvey catchment. Figure 7.3: Nitrogen (top) and phosphorus (bottom) surplus and nutrient use efficiency (NUE), ranked by land-use. Figure 7.4: Reporting catchments for the Peel-Harvey. Figure 7.5: Winter median observed and modelled total nitrogen (top) and total phosphorus (bottom) concentrations. All sites represent the 2011–2015 period except 614037, which represents 1995–2000. The locations of these sites are given in Fig. 6. 7.4.4 Coupling to the estuary model This model was used to provide inputs of water flow, total nitrogen and total phosphorus to the estuary hydrological and biogeochemical models developed in other components of the Linkage Project (Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019b). The locations of catchment inputs to the estuary model are shown Fig. 6. For the catchment model outputs prior to 2000, an adjustment was needed to correct for an underestimation of the flow by the model in this period. This underestimation was likely due to the catchment model being calibrated during a dry period from 2000–2015 (see section 4.3). This bias correction was only applied to model outputs used for the estuary model inputs prior to 2000. Details of how this bias was adjusted are given in Appendix 1. 7.4.5 Scenarios This calibrated catchment nutrient model was used to explore a range of scenarios relating to (i) land-use change, (ii) nutrient management and (iii) climate. Specifically for the ARC Linkage Project, a set of eight scenarios were run using this model that aligned with the three 2050 narratives identified by Peel stakeholders (‘environmentally optimistic, ’business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic/economically optimistic’; Hipsey et al. 2019a), i.e. two scenarios for each narrative and two further scenarios to represent the ‘base case’ or current conditions. A summary of the model configurations underpinning each scenario is given in Hipsey et al. (2019a), and a detailed account of the fuller range of scenarios is given in Hennig et al. (in prep.). Figure 7.6: Catchment model inputs to the estuary model (white circles) and catchment monitoring sites (circle with site number). 7.5 Main Findings 7.5.1 Flows and loads to the Peel-Harvey Estuary Average annual loads (2006–2015) of nutrients estimated to be exported from the Peel-Harvey catchment were lower than the previous reporting period, mainly due to reduced river flow The nutrient load from all catchments is approximately 830 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 90 tonnes per year of phosphorus. The loads to the Peel-Harvey Estuary were estimated to be 630 tonnes of nitrogen and 60 tonnes of phosphorus (with the remainder flowing out to the ocean or stored in dams). Estimated flows and nutrient loads were substantially lower than estimated in previous modelling by Kelsey et al. (2011), which gave results for the period of 1997–2007. During the current modelling period of 2006–15, the climate was drier and thus resulted in less river flow and nutrient loading to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. However, concentrations of nutrients from the current model remain excessive. All estuary catchments on the coastal plain had flow-weighted concentrations in excess of ANZECC guidelines (2000) for lowland rivers (1.2 mg/L TN and 0.065 TP). A detailed discussion about water quality targets will be given in a detailed technical report that is currently being prepared by the DWER. Most nutrients are delivered to the estuary in winter Actual nutrient loads in a given year have a fairly tight relationship to flow, as shown in Fig. 7. More than 90% of the flow and nutrient is discharged during the winter months (June-October). 7.5.2 Source of nutrients Of the 13 catchments modelled, three catchments (Harvey, Lower Murray and Upper Serpentine) contribute 60% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus load to the estuary Overall, the catchments that delivered the greatest loads of nutrients to the Peel-Harvey estuary were: Nitrogen: Harvey (205 tonnes, 32%) Lower Murray (103 tonnes, 16%) Upper Murray (80 tonnes, 13%) Upper Serpentine (72 tonnes, 11%). Phosphorus: Harvey (20 tonnes, 33%) Upper Serpentine (10 tonnes, 17%) Nambeelup (6.7 tonnes, 11%) Lower Murray (6.2 tonnes, 10%). The nutrient loads per cleared area of estuary catchments (excluding the Upper Murray) are 3.6 kg/ha/yr of nitrogen and 0.39 kg/ha/yr of phosphorus. The catchments with the greatest average annual nutrient loads that drain to the estuary are, for nitrogen: (1) Harvey (6.1 kg/cleared ha); (2) Dirk Brook (4.1 kg/cleared ha); (3) Nambeelup (3.7 kg/cleared ha) and, for phosphorus: (1) Nambeelup (0.61 kg/cleared ha); (2) Harvey (0.59 kg/cleared ha); (3) Lower Serpentine (0.42 kg/cleared ha). The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen: beef (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy (6.8%) and, for phosphorus: beef (67%), dairy (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%) The above land-uses above account for approximately 80% of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads delivered to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Beef is clearly the largest source of nutrients in the Peel-Harvey catchment. This is primarily due to the large area of beef farming (Fig. 2), its high nutrient surplus rate, poor nutrient-use efficiency (&lt;10%) and its location on the Swan Coastal Plain (high rainfall and large areas of low PRI soils). Intensive animal uses (piggeries, abattoirs, poultry, feedlots and stockyards) contribute &lt;5% of the total nutrient load. While this could be considered small at an estuary catchment scale, the nutrient load is much greater at a reporting catchment scale. For instance, 17% of the phosphorus load of the Meredith catchment is estimated to originate from piggeries. Point sources (e.g. wastewater treatment plans, industrial sources, composting facilities) contribute &lt;1% of the nutrient load. However, septic tank nutrient contributions are much larger, accounting for 3.1% and 2.6% of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads, respectively, reaching the estuary. Figure 7.7: Annual flow and nitrogen and phosphorus loads from the major river catchments to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 7.6 Conclusions The calibrated catchment model estimates that, on average, 630 tonnes of nitrogen and 60 tonnes of phosphorus reaches the Peel-Harvey Estuary per year – with disproportionately greater loads coming from a few catchments The catchments that contribute the greatest average annual nutrient loads per cleared area are, for nitrogen: Harvey (6.1 kg/cleared ha), Dirk Brook (4.1 kg/cleared ha), Nambeelup (3.7 kg/cleared ha), and for phosphorus: Nambeelup (0.61 kg/cleared ha), Harvey (0.59 kg/cleared ha), Lower Serpentine (0.42 kg/cleared ha), Beef cattle farming was the land-use responsible for the majority of both nitrogen and phosphorus exported to the estuary The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen: beef (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy (6.8%) and, for phosphorus: beef (67%), dairy (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%). 7.7 Acknowledgements This project has been supported by funding by the Regional Estuaries Initiative, a Western Australian State Government investment in the health of south-west estuaries.
