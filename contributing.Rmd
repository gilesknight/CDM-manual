## RStudio's visual editor

If you're unfamiliar with writing `.Rmd` and `.md` files, the [RStudio IDE 1.4](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/) release implements a visual markdown editor that minimises the need to learn most syntax. To use this feature, open a `.Rmd` or `.md` file and click the visual editor button in the top right-hand corner of the editor window. You will now see a live-rendered version of your document and the addition of numerous buttons/menus that provide a GUI for formatting. Standard word processing functionality, such as buttons to **bold**, *italicise*, and [underline]{.ul} text are available, as well as shortcuts to features that can be more finicky in the basic source editor (e.g. citations, links, and simple tables). Returning to the source editor will reveal and formatting changes made are directly translated to the syntax of the raw file.
